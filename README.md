# Rating Regional Reviews

This repository contains the code for "Rating Regional Reviews: Do Regional Differences Impact Sentiment Analysis?" by Amani Maina-Kilaas, Georgia Witchel, Andy Liu, and Harry Weale, and was submitted for our [CS159 (NLP) Spring 2022](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/cs-159-spring-2022) Final Project. In this project, we explored how regional differences in the United States can impact sentiment analysis, and how a business's location caused language used in its Yelp reviews to differ. We did so by using the sentiment proxy of rating prediction accuracy using Naive Bayes and XGBoost models. 

All relevant code can be run directly from the notebook using the repo data. Data was randomly sampled from the publicly available [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).
