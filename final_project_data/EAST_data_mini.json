Then there's the arrogant indifferent owner - making the rounds to randomly ask those (with their food already) 'how is everything'?  The noise and the crowdedness of the place is a real turn-off too - - you literally cannot hear the person next to you at your table. Is BYOB worth this experience? We think not..... And the famous bruschetta a lot of reviews raved about - we never saw it - - our waiters (we had two) 'forgot' to bring us some. And  offered nothing else at the end of our $60 meal - - not coffee, dessert, NADA.  So that was what we based our tip on - poor service equals a poor tip. Never going back no matter how good the food was. There are other good Italian restaurants within a short drive. Time to give them a try!.","stars":2}

I ordered a tossed Greek salad with extra grilled onions and a cup of chicken orzo soup to go.  I got home and the salad did not have the extra grilled onions, and all the other ingredients in the salad were skimpy.  They didn't shake the Greek dressing before filling the togo dressing cups, so mine was straight oil.  The worst part was my soup (which mind you is usually my favorite).  There was not ONE piece of orzo in it.  It was an entire container of shredded chicken and a small amount of broth.  You could hardly see the broth because there was so much chicken.  It was definitely the bottom of the soup pot.  I wish they would have told me they were running out of soup and I wouldn't have ordered it.

The Dan Dan noodles, while spicy, weren't overpowering. I scarfed them down so quickly, I wasn't sure if I'd have any room for my meal! They were so good I wanted to just dive into a pool of them and gorge myself all day! I ordered a scallop dish (the exact name escapes me but it was on the center of the page, if that's helpful!) which was cooked to perfection. The pork dumplings were great as well, though I had trouble eating them with chopsticks and took them home to eat in the privacy of my house without looking like a piglet!\n\nEveryone working was extremely friendly. Although the food was coming out slowly, it was worth it. The staff checked in frequently - just enough to be very helpful, but never taking it to an annoying extreme. The atmosphere is relaxed and very quiet, leading two loud Italians to be a bit out of place. However, we were never once looked at with a side eye or an evil stare, and we did actively work to keep our voices lower than normal - not an easy task! \n\nI cannot wait to revisit Han Dynasty and try out more of the wonderful food (and spicier dishes, as I get braver!).","stars":5}

She is under my family plan and I gave her the authority to this in her own time, as I was busy. Every Verizon (corporate owned) store I have been to has been exceptional and trustworthy.\nThis store has a large Verizon sign on the side of the building, making those going to the store under the impression that it is a\nLegitimate Verizon store. There is a small sign on the door the says wireless zone, the\nActual name of the store. \nThis is a very long and frustrating story and I will give the PS version. Zohair charged my niece $960 for an iPhone 6. This price is $160 more than the cost of the iPhone 8, which she wound up purchasing from a legitimate Verizon location. When noticing the cost I went and and wanted to return the phone and cut ties with this store completely. The store owner, Chris, told me I had two options: they could fix their $500 mistake or I could return products paying $120 for restocking. I wound up calling corporate from this store at which time I was told that restocking charge should only be $35. Only At this time, while corporate was one the phone, did Chris try and \"manipulate\" the system so that we wouldn't be charged the $120 restocking.\nIn the end with a huge headache and hours of wasted time, I returned my items without the outrageous fee they were trying to then scam me out of. If I would have been of a different demographic their lies may have worked on me (ie elderly or young adult like my 21 year old niece)!\nThere are many more details that include more lies, deception and degregation of character that I would love to include.  The bottom line is do not go to this store for any reason at all, the guarantee to be lied to will be upheld!\nI will be writing to the better business bureau and the corporate offices of Verizon. I am disgraced by the dishonesty of this store and their ability to take advantage of consumers with no remorse!!!'","stars":1}

The staff are friendly and well educated about the items that they are serving. One of the best pieces of advice that our service gave us - \"pace yourselves\". They serve an abundant meal. I should also mention that in making your reservation, they ask a lot of questions about food allergies and preferences so that they can work your meal around those things.\n\nThe cocktails are creative and there is room to change out your spirits as I did with the lemonnana. They make it with bourbon but it was lovely with gin and I would definitely order it again. There's also a nice and very global wine list.\n\nThe salad course was first with fresh laffa bread and hummus. I loved this part. It was basically six separate vegetable courses ranging from a beautiful beet dish to carrots and green beans. I am definitely stealing this idea for my own entertaining going forward.\n\nOur mezze course had four separate plates, all shared at the table ranging for an amazing haloumi to grilled apricots and mackerel. In the next course (referred to as al ha'esh), I loved the maitake mushroom. Honestly, it could have been my full meal. We selected the lamb shoulder for our entr\u00e9e but they also have a cauliflower entr\u00e9e that I will try when I go back.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I am really not sure why there are raving reviews for this place. I either had a very rare (doubtful) awful experience or I am just spoiled by the cheaper and more professional nail care i get from New York.\n\nOriginally from NYC, I just moved to Yardley, PA and was looking for a good nail salon. After reading reviews on yelp, I decided to give this place a try instead of the place right around the corner from me. \n\nBoy was I misled. \n\nFirst off, I made an appointment at 5:45 for a mani\/pedi and they started working on me at 7PM. Ridiculous. Around 6:20 they started to soak my feet in warm water but I had to ask them to clean the tub as there was dirt and hair and other remnants of paper (?) floating around. \n\nBy the time I actually got my pedicure started, the water was cold. \n\nThe woman i got was very unattentive, she rushed through my pedicure and my french manicure and finished everything by 7:30 (yes a total of 30 minutes). I had bright pink nail polish on my nails before and she didn't pay enough attention to take all of my nail polish off and now my 'french manicure' has pink stripes running down the sides. How unprofessional. \n\nShe also messed up a few of my finger nails as the white hadn't dried (I mean, she WAS rushing) and the white ended up getting smeared onto the base of my nail. Instead of doing it over, she put insane amounts of top coat to try to 'fix' it and now i have streaks of white on my nail...\n\nWhat topped it off was that she tried to charge me MORE than what other was being charged for a mani\/pedi after I was told specifically how much it was when it started. (Yes, i took into account the extra charge for the french addition). It was ridiculous. \n\nThis place does not let you tip with card, and cost $10 more than a place I go to in NYC. I will never come to this place ever again and I do not recommend that you do so either. \n\nMaybe there isn't a better place around me to get my nails done, but boy do I hope there is as this place is awful.","stars":1}

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday weekend surprise celebration, AFTER we had already enjoyed a wonderful lunch at another Starr enterprise Alma de Cuba. \n\nOur waiter was probably the best one I've had in a very long time; he was very friendly and attentive, and KNEW HIS STUFF.

One word: YUMMY. It tasted amazingly good, and was stronger than I thought because I didn't need another one ;)\n\nUnfortunately, we weren't very hungry because of our large lunch, so we shared two appetizers and an entree. I love mediterranean cuisine, and expressly because not only does it feature SEAFOOD (my fav), but it also presents it simply to bring out the flavor of the fish if done well - AND IT WAS DONE WELL.\n\nOur appetizers were the grilled calamari salad with chopped cucumber, tomatoes, mint and pita croutons with an olive vinagrette, and a special seared Sakai salmon served over roasted eggplant with lebne. The calamari was cooked perfectly, it was tender and NOT rubbery, however the salmon stole the show. I dislike salmon, but this type was DELICIOUS, and the lebne complemented it perfectly! As an entree, we shared the crispy striped bass with white gazpacho (cucumber) and farro salad, simply done with extraordinary flavors. I've never had farro with such a complex taste. \n\nUnfortunately, we did not have time for dessert since we had a show to catch, but I've decided that Tangerine is my current obsession - especially for those sinful cocktails.

(back in 1995), as one of my childhood friends hooked me up with a tour, as that time he was living in D.C. and working for the late senator Daniel Akaka. \n\nIn 2011, my old boss (he's retired now) sent me up to the east coast for work, and I found myself working in New Jersey, & Philadelphia during the summer...........a fun & great experience, and that is how I ended up visiting the United States Mint in Philly............\nHonestly, I knew there was a mint in Philadelphia, but I wasn't planning on actually visiting this place, but over the weekend while exploring the beautiful city of Philadelphia, I just so happen to run into this place, so I said to myself - \"why not? I'm here already!\".\n\nOf course since I am in the business of money, you know very well that I had to check out this place! \nNo reservations were needed, as I just walked into the joint. \nThe entire tour is self guided...........and no, you cannot just walk around freely where they make the actual money folks...........otherwise folks will be trying to stuff their pockets full of money! Lol! \n\nThe tour of the mint itself is in an elevated glass enclosed gallery area, and as you walk, you look down, and you can see the things going on with the process of making money. \nDon't worry folks, there are signs along the tour, and the signs will explain what's going on in the various areas of the building.\n\nWhile you take the tour, there was a \"walkman\" like type of thing, where you could wear on your head while taking the tour, as the device gives you a \"voice tour\" while you walk along the tour............ i'm not sure if there was a charge for the device, but when I took the tour I elected to not to wear this, as the last thing I need is to catch some ookus (head lice) on my head! Lol!\n\nThe self guided tours are Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM, there is no admission fee (Dealages Yo! Free Baby!!!) \nFor Weekends, please call at (215) 408-0114 to see availability. \nLike I said before, I came here on a weekend (Saturday)............so I guess I just lucked out when I just so happen to run into this place while visiting the city.\n\nAlso, I just wanted to let you folks know.............once you go inside of the Mint (to take the tour), they DO NOT ALLOW PHOTOS! \nI swear when I went to the Mint in Washington D.C. back in 1995, I thought they allowed photos, but my memory may be fading.......if it was allowed back then, it was before  9\/11, and by the time I saw the Mint in Philadelphia,  it was way after 9\/11. Posible \"no photo\" rule due to security???\n\nOn the brochure I picked up from the Philadelphia Mint, let me share with you a little about the Mint Story -\n\nGeorge Washington was president and Philadelphia was the nation's capital. It was April 2, 1792, and an act of Congress provided for a national coinage and the establishment of the U.S. Mint.\nThe first Mint was erected at 7th and Arch Streets. As the young nation grew, larger Mint buildings were needed. The present Mint, which opened on August 14, 1969 is the fourth in Philadelphia. \nThe Philadelphia Mint is part of a nationwide Treasury agency. From headquarter in Washington D.C., the Director oversees the Mints in Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, West Point, and the Bullion Depository at Fort Knox.\n\nThey said that the huge machines at the Mint can work 24 hours of the day, 5 days a week making coins. \n\nThere is a process of making a coin, they are -\n\n1. Blanking\n2. Annealing, Washing and Drying\n3. Riddling\n4. Upsetting\n5. Striking\n6. Inspecting\nAnd last of all..............\n7. Counting and Bagging of the coins.\n\n A pretty cool place to visit, and I would say a \"must see\" if you're ever in Philadelphia! \n\nCheck 'em out gang! No can go wrong!","stars":5}

Although they try to push the customer to come into the property when they're not there to do any loss mitigation work. When the customer tries to explain that they themselves need to be there on the premises. However, based on my experience with the admin part of the company especially with Danielle, I would say be very careful when dealing with her. She has a bad habit of being argumentative, threatening, lying behavior and being manipulative. She will make up things to your insurance company so as to cause problems and does not listen to the customer. She will try to deflect her part of her responsibility and throw it back to the customer. She will disconnect phone calls when she doesn't want to listen to the customer and their concerns. If I could rate this company a 0 I would. Because of her behavior towards me as customer, I would implore anyone whom is looking for a loss mitigation business to employ, do not use them.","stars":1}

If I never see another Renoir again, I'll be fine.  There are almost as many Cezannes, but I could never tire of Cezanne.  Cezanne's painted oranges are almost better than the eating of real, ripe oranges.  \n\nThere's a Cross and a Signac, both beautiful.  Not so many Picassos but the ones here are from his Blue period and are excellent.  One rare Van Gogh nude, and also his famous Postman, which is referenced a billion times in movies and pop media anytime someone stands in front of colorful wallpaper.  Also Modiglianis and Soutines and Pascins, and quite a few painters less known.  (There's also non-European art, but European modern art from the 19th-20th centuries really dominates.)\n\nIt's a small museum compared to places like the Met or even MoMA, but it's densely and uniquely packed.  You could probably have a good visit in under two hours, but I was here 4-5 and it felt like not enough.  To quote a stranger I chatted with during my visit, \"This place really keeps on giving.\"\n\n(1) Speaking of legal hoops, if you're curious, there's a movie about this: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Art_of_the_Steal_%282009_film%29","stars":5}

Both main courses felt very filling atop the two appetizers and bread that were also at our table.  I absolutely would go back, even just for a casual dinner spot with a bit more class to it.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I've taken a lot of clothing here in the 25 years I've lived nearby and the cleaning has always been done well. The owners, however, are less than acceptable and after the very offensive behavior of the woman yesterday, I will no longer be able to go there at all. In the early years, it was just her quiet but aloof attitude. In recent years it's gotten a lot worse and can only be described as nastiness at best or a medical problem in the worst case. It's hard to imagine her husband, who is at the store some days, or her family do not do something and get her the medical care she likely needs. Not seeing her on a daily basis, the changes in her behavior are more noticable to me. A couple years ago she started exhibiting erratic behavior such as charging in advance for cleaning some of the time. She would say hello sometimes when I went in the store and at others would simply snarl \"how many?\"  They are close to my home so I didn't let any of this bother me because I liked the convenience. At first I thought the behavior changes were because I didn't have as many things to dry clean. But over time, it became clear her attitude and behavior were unrelated to that at all. I've always been pleasant no matter how nasty she was, mainly because I wanted to continue to have my things cleaned there. Her husband has always been reasonably pleasant and always polite. He at least said hello and goodbye when customers entered or left. Things got steadily worse when she was there. In addition to wanting money in advance just sometimes, shd began charging different amounts for the same item of clothing each time I took it in. Prices generally went very much higher but ocassionally lower too. Prices were always the same when her husband was there. When shd was there, prices fluctuated with her mood. At times the charges were so high, it seemed something was wrong but I contued to go back. When she is in this odd behavior mode, she seems to treat all the customers with equal disdain. Finally yesterday things reached a new low and I will no longer go there. I took in a white button down shirt and she refused to clean or launder it. She claims they do not do one shirt. I really need this shirt and reminded her I just had it cleaned by itself and definitely remember it was the only item cleaned on the hanger when I wore it. I was pleasant as always but she became obviously infuriated and started repeating never one shirt, never. I did not argue but asked her to make an exception this one time as it was urgent. She was adament she would not do one shirt this day. I didn't mention to her the fact that there is no sign inside or outside stating this. \nI hope this review serves two purposes. Unless you don't mind the erratic and terribly rude, insulting behavior, you will do best to try one of the many other cleaners in the area. \nSecondly, I hope her husband or family see this and take seriously her need for help. There is something very wrong when behavior changes to this degree and everone deserves a chance to get some help.","stars":1}

I inevitably spend way too much money at this store.\n\nThere are tons of interesting ingredients and food.  If you want a specialty item, this store may have it.  Certainly they have just about every cheese or cured meat you can imagine.  The workers tend to be very helpful and willing to spend time with you to find the perfect cheese.  The samples are also addicting.  I am not as fond of their pre-made sandwiches because I hate tomatoes, but their sandwiches made to order are always good.  I also love their bread.\n\nHowever, you can easily spend a lot of money FAST.  Some things are worth the money, and I try to just limit my quantities, but I still find myself indulging in too many impulse purchases here.  Also, one time I came in looking for some meats to send to my brother.  I found the butcher to be extremely unhelpful and unwilling to walk me through the different options.  I settled on something at his recommendation, and my brother said that it was moldy.  Considering this was a cured, dry meat, that absolutely should not have happened (in their defense, it was pre-packaged and you could not see inside the package, so maybe no one knew).  By contrast, on a very crowded Sunday at their Italian Market location, a very helpful butcher was willing to walk me and a friend through their many options and was extremely helpful.  Maybe the guy was having an off day, but it was a little frustrating.  However, I have generally had good experiences there and continue to go back.\n\nThat paragraph may make you question why this place gets four stars, but seriously it is a food paradise.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I came to Llama Tooth initially expecting something fantastic and was sorely disappointed.  Stars are for the huge patio seating area, funky reggae music, and drinks, which make for potentially relaxing happy hours after work.  Sadly, the other parts of the restaurant failed to make a good impression at all.\n\nPrices are reasonable for the portions of food and drinks.  Tried the following: mushroom truffle mac and cheese, pulled pork mac and cheese, chicken gyro, veggie burger, sweet potato fries.  What was notable was that the friends, who are normally not picky about their dinners, kept saying how little flavour everything had.  Sweet potato fries were gigantic, as if large sweet potatoes had been quartered lengthwise and fried.  Impressive only in size, not in taste or quality.  Veggie burger was probably the only standout on the menu with great seasoning and execution, though they could've held off on the large amount of raw red onion.\n\nService was friendly enough but extremely slow as molasses; food did come out warm but getting our order put in, fresh glasses of water, plates cleared, and receiving our check took forever.  For folks like us that tend to linger over drinks for ages and forget about leaving, the length of time between everything was noticeable.  Other tables nearby seemed to be suffering the same waits as well.\n\nGiven that this place is right across the street from Union Transfer, I'd probably be likely to return here solely for a pre-concert drink given their extensive beer list and welcoming patio seating.","stars":2}

If you want a great atmosphere for conversation, wonderfully crafted drinks made from top-shelf-only liquors, and attentive service, you'll find yourself back in their leather booths over and over again. \n\nThe decor is 1920s speakeasy. Marble, leather, and wood in a low, dark room with a small bar at the end. There's no standing room, so you will need to wait for a seat to open up if it's crowded. This keeps the place from feeling cluttered, I like it. \n\nDrinks are obviously the Franklin's raison d'etre. The drinks are carefully measured, most likely over-proof, and delicious. Also, the bartenders are great, so one needn't stick to the menu if you feel like something on the more obscure side.  All of this mixing, tasting, measuring, and fine-tuning takes time, so please don't expect your drink in 30 seconds, and don't expect to pay $5. Drinks are expensive, but you only need one or two.

I miss my boy Nick, too, but what are you gonna do?\n\nThe food is top notch here.  The pizzas are legendary, and as good as you've indubitably heard.  The wings are delicious.  The sliders are the only thing I don't like on the menu.  I even got a great hunk of prime rib here once, but that seemed to be a one-off.\n\nThe beer selection is vast, I'd estimate 12-20 beers between draft and bottles.  I prefer the IPAs, with 113 being my go-to unless Odyssey or a varietal IPA are on.  The saisons are solid, but most of the other styles don't blow me away.  Keep up the experimental hop IPAs, please.\n\nThe prices are reasonable, and the growler prices may be the fairest I've seen, and a growler card is a must.\n\nThe events are fun, but get there early, as they become a shit show quickly.","stars":4}

Service was quite good, the beer selection is decent (although when a place is called a \"brewing company\" it does heighten expectation and do not be fooled, they do not brew their own beer...), and food was delicious.  I ordered the burger, which did not disappoint.  The applewood smoked bacon and Kennett mushrooms certainly enhanced the flavor.

What you see is what you get, and I've never felt so lucky to have met Carmen et al. And I don't know what I'm going to do now that I've moved out of Philly. Carmen took such good care of me and my skin. I went there regularly for facials. I bought the package deals so many times. Totally worth it!  I have combination, acne-prone skin. Under Carmen's wonderful care, my skin is clear. Best extractions EVER. The first thing my family back home in California says when they see me is \"Your face looks amazing!\" She adjusted the facial depending on the condition of my skin that day. Always fair. Always honest. The key is to go regularly. And stay hydrated. Things that Carmen always reminded me. \n\nCarmen understood how busy I was so she always found ways to fit me into her busy schedule. She was always honest with me about my skin. She never pushes anything on me. And in the rare instances she made a suggestion, I just said \"Whatever you want, Carmen.\"\n\nEveryone there is lovely, funny, hardworking, and will be missed so much. I'm lost without them. \n\nYou can bet that if I ever visit Philly, I'm seeing Carmen.\n\nJust do what I learned to do: TRUST CARMEN!","stars":5}

The sea bass was MASSIVE. i swear they injected something in there to fluff it up because it was thick, but light served over a bed of greens.

I really enjoyed all of the appetizers (4 tapas) and entrees (again, 4 tapas). I did feel a little rushed as they continued to pile food onto our table even before we were finished some of the plates. I guess a place like that needs to get people in and out during restaurant week. I probably would not go back unless there is another deal going on, simply because I left still a little hungry and that menu is of course, not cheap. Food was definitely terrific though.","stars":4}

The square pizza is awesome, it tasted like a classic slice of tomato pie but with cheese below the sauce.

The bartender was very accommodating and went through the menu and drink specials with us. They had an array of amazing craft beers to the regular man's selection to a solid citywide (6$ Goose Is. 312 with Heaven Hill). The main menu featured a spin on Indian food with solid naan and chicken tikka masla. A slow burn with a heavy chickpea load. I have never tasted a more unique tikka dish. The pork Banh Mi was also very solid. Overall, I will be back to snag some beers to go and have a couple beers and chill to watch some sports.","stars":4}

After looking at their website and emailing a little we decided to go with it.  The price was amazing for what we got!  We paid for the wedding ourselves, hence the dessert reception, so it wasn't a huge grand event, but we wanted something our guests would enjoy.  Without a doubt T.H.E. was the hit of the reception!  The line was huge from the moment we walked in, and only by having my giant of a best man ask for two drinks for the bride and groom did we even get to try anything!  \n\nThe coffee selection was great, the baristas were wonderful, and everything went so well with cookies, brownies, and cakes we had.

My favorite part was quietly in print, looking at me from the top of the menu, in quotations, \"the food you eat standing up doesn't count.\"  Love it, mean it.  \nI had shrimp with anchovy butter that was flaky and delicious.  I kind of wish the shrimp came peeled already, but I understand how the delicate flavor may have been compromised.  Still, my hands were covered in oil and sharp pieces of shrimp peel, and it would have been nice to get a hot napkin or something between courses.  Of course, I got to visit the classy bathroom sink and catch a glimpse of the awesome kitchen area once inside.  \nDinner was a huge ribeye steak with classic pomme frites.  When I started eating the steak I found delicious sugar snap peas hiding under my dish, swimming in the lovely drippings.  Surprise!  You know, it's the little things we find the most pleasure from, and that was pleasurable.  \nDessert was a perfect emulsion of chocolate ganache tart, beautifully decorated.  I forgot to ask whether desserts are made in house, but I know that they offer bent spoon ice cream, even though it doesn't say so on the menu....?  \n\nDo I even need to mention anymore that it's a BYOB?

The cabbage leaves and stuffed grape leaves were equally delightful. \n\nNow, here's my favorite: a simple but absolutely delicious side: Mjadra: cooked lentils, seasoned rice topped with perfectly caramelized onions. Together with their hot and fresh falafels, easily one of the best in the city, these glorious balls of chickpeas and fave beans paired with tahini sauce will BLOW your mind!\n\nTheir entrees from their kebob (grilled meat) platters: Shish Taouk (grilled chicken skewers), kafta (grilled lamb with onion, parsley and spice) and Laham Mishwi (skewered lamb kebob) over a simply yet absolutely delicious bed of perfectly cooked rice & angel hair strands = a MEAT lover's dream!\n\nKANAFI: is all you need to say for dessert! and Baklava. I won't ruin the surprise for you. Just try it :)\n\nI cannot vouch for the authenticity of this restaurant any more. A restaurant that was established in 1986 with absolutely no frills but just delicious home cooked meals! When you're done with fufu fifi meals, come enjoy a delicious traditional treat at Cedars! and say hi to Yassan the owner and Elias his nephew!

Things happen, but we should have been offered a partial refund or coupon. This order was over $800 and it was 100% not what we expect for spending that much money. We had to ask for a partial refund.\n-The restaurant ran out of catering trays and brought metal pans they use in the oven. Dave, the owner, promised to come get them and bring us our receipt and our refund on Monday. The pans were too large for us to wash in our sink, so they took up counter space and started to smell. He didn't show up until Wednesday, with only half the refund amount we'd agreed on.\n\nWe love supporting local businesses and had the experience been better, we would have added Coreanos to our catering rotation and placed repeat orders. Unfortunately, that will not be happening.","stars":2}

{"region":"EAST","text":"I would give zero stars if it was possible. \n\nFirst and last time at Golden Nails on Sunday, June 16. I had dip powder on my fingers and gel on my toes - and wanted both a gel pedicure and a dip manicure. The color cards they gave me were wrong (even though I asked if these colors came in both gel and dip - told yes) so after my pedicure I had to pick out a new color that sort of matched my toes. Then, the guy doing my nails kept telling me that I should have told them I had dip on my nails because it takes so long to soak off. I told him I did but no one seemed to care. And rather than wait for the dip to soak off completely, he used the tool to remove the dip powder. Because of that he put 5 layers of dip on my nails, assuring me he would smooth them out and make them thin but my nails were uneven so he needed to do it that way  and yet my nails are thick, crooked, uneven and look horrible. I'd been there for 2.5 hours and was just so over it. They then charged me $45 for my dip manicure because \"I needed 5 layers of dip\" - which I wouldn't have needed if they had just let me soak my nails off the right way!\n\nAlso - while I was getting my nails done, the lady next to me asked to have her dip taken off to go back to acrylic and the man (John), CUT HER DIP NAILS OFF WITH A CUTICLE TRIMMER!","stars":1}

It didn't seem as though she properly neutralized the peel especially with a dry piece of rough paper towel. There was even some acid left on my earlobe which unfortunately left an acid burn. And I've left feeling quite tender but it wasn't until the next morning did I fully see the damage that was done to my skin.

{"region":"EAST","text":"We enjoyed our breakfast at Sabrina's Cafe and Spencer's Too in Logan Square, Center City. This local restaurant chain was recommended to us by three separate friends as one of Philadelphia's best spots for breakfast and brunch (they serve lunch and dinner too). The food was good and service was great. While I don't think this place is *significantly* better than other popular and highly-regarded brunch restaurants I've tried, it's still definitely worth checking out if you want American breakfast\/brunch comfort food. The food is delicious, though heavy, and the portions are huge and filling.\n\nThere are five Sabrina's locations in the Delaware Valley including three in Philly proper. This location is the second and it opened in 2007 (the first opened in 2001). Sabrina's is named after the owners' daughter. This particular location has \"and Spencer's Too\" in the name because of the owners' son, who was born later. We chose to dine at this location because it was close to our hotel, the Philadelphia 201, which is only a couple blocks away; a short walk. If you're staying at this hotel or anywhere nearby, I do recommend Sabrina's for breakfast\/brunch.\n\nI heard this place gets packed with waits the norm. We showed up bright and early on a Monday morning just before opening (8am). A small crowd had already built up on the sidewalk in front of the entrance. When the doors opened, all of us were seated immediately. This place has plenty of space. It has a diner feel to it. You can sit at the counter with its cushioned and pattern-upholstered chairs or at one of the numerous small tables or booths. The atmosphere is casual and homey. There's a tiled coffee bar and lampshades with floral designs.\n\nDuring our visit, the large blackboard menu on the dining room's center wall featured chalk drawings of Sonic and Knuckles (random). Specials included chicken and waffles ($14.95) and dinner entrees like seafood scampi ($15.95) and goat cheese penne pasta ($14.95). We also received a seasonal drink menu and monthly food specials.\n\nSabrina's signature breakfast items are the huevos rancheros ($11.79), stuffed challah French toast ($11.99), and \"The Tots\" ($12.59). Other breakfast\/brunch foods include eggs, frittatas, omelettes, pancakes, bagels and lox, housemade granola, avocado toast, and a quinoa bowl. Most of these other items cost about the same or less than the signature items. Most non-breakfast\/brunch food includes soups and salads and burgers and sandwiches. Expect to spend about $11-13 each for those items. They have a kids menu too. Beverage-wise, they offer coffee and espresso-based drinks, teas, fresh juices, and Jones brand \"craft\" soda.\n\nWe ordered two signature items and a couple seasonal drinks:\n\n* Stuffed Challah French Toast ($11.99) with farmer's cream cheese topped with bananas and vanilla bean syrup\n* The Tots ($12.59) - fried panko-encrusted tater tots topped with grilled hot sausage hash; caramelized onions, bell peppers, and fennel seed; topped with basil chimichurri, sour cream, and over-easy eggs\n* Cookie Butter Iced Mocha ($4.79) - cookie butter, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n* Iced Strawberry Mocha ($4.79) - strawberry, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n\nThe food was great. I preferred the Stuffed Challah French Toast over The Tots, but I could change my mind given the day. The French toast was outstanding. The best thing about it to me was the filling: farmer's cream cheese. I'm a cream cheese fan in general, but this particular cream cheese was lighter and less dense than your typical American cream cheese. Its silky smooth texture trended towards whipped cream. Overall, wonderful flavor when combined with the vanilla bean syrup (I love vanilla). Ripe slices of banana and a bit of cinnamon and powdered sugar were thrown on top. The consistency of the French toast itself was soft, springy, and appetizing. I recommend this dish.\n\nThe Tots was heavy, but satisfying. It's a lot of food packed into a medium-sized bowl. The panko-encrusted tater tots were bigger than average tots. They were like tots on steroids. The ingredients, particularly the hot sausage hash and the over-easy eggs, came out temperature hot from the kitchen. I had to wait for the bowl to cool down a bit. This one was a savory, greasy smorgasbord of textures and flavors. I had the tots with ketchup and ate the rest of the dish with various hot sauces at the table (Cholula, Frank's RedHot, Sriracha). If you have a ravenous appetite, The Tots is for you; it's packed with lots of carbs and protein.\n\nThe iced mochas were good. They were expectedly sweet; almost too sweet for me (and I have a sweet tooth). I liked the Cookie Butter Iced Mocha better than the Strawberry. Both drinks were rich, flavorful, and refreshing. The dark chocolate flavor was strong. If you order these, you might ask if you can adjust the sweetness.\n\nPatricia was our server and she was attentive and sweet. The hostess was nice too.\n\nI'd come back.","stars":4}

Went to the South Street store on Saturday the 4th December and asked the cashier if I could order a dozen of their Hanukkah Jelly donuts for the next day.

I went to order a dozen and saw that they offered 15 donuts if you ordered online for 21.00.  Thought this was very reasonable since the store posted a dozen donuts for 25.00 dollars. However, when I went to order them I received a message that you could not order these donuts for the South Stree store. So the next morning I went over to South Street and requested a dozen of their Hanukkah donuts.   The sales person said no problem and I assumed I would not be offered their special online price but that a dozen would be 25.00 dollars.  To my surprise the salesperson said that will be 42.00. Needless to say I was surprised and asked why to which I was told the online price was for mini Haukkah donuts and since these were normal size donuts and they were made specially for the Jewish Holiday they were more per dozen than their normal jelly donuts.  I'm sorry but 42.00 dollars for a dozen Jelly donuts appears to be highway robbery to me. I don't recall any notice on their website about \"mini\" donuts.  Next time I need donuts they will come from Dunkin.  I bought the Federal Donuts because I needed them.  They were tasty but certainly not worth 42.00\/dozen.  I saw nothing in the store that said anything about mini-donuts.   A real rip-off.","stars":2}

The expected accompaniments are there for your consideration: pita, hummus, cous cous, falafel, shawarma, etc.  One can arrange their plates\/bowls as they see fit.  I elected a basmati rice\/chicken shawarma\/chopped cabbage bowl with harissa (spicy!) sauce. It definitely hit the spot! \n\nCon:  Definitely more of a lunch location than a dinner option, in my opinion...\n\nBottom Line:  Do you love the Chipotle experience, yet want a different taste?  This is it!","stars":4}

While for the price of the room I would have enjoyed a bathtub, and if you lean on the back of the shower you will moon your roommates, it was nice having extra space cleared up. The bar downstairs is a fun place to go, drinks are not expensive, and they do occasionally have live entertainment. \n\nMy one complaint is that you need to be sure the price that you are promised when you call the 800 number to book is the same you are charged. An issue like this happened more than once, with the actual site trying to charge more than what I was told. First time I didn't have the confirmation email, but the second time I was smarter and had it.","stars":3}

My significant other got an omelette and the breakfast potatoes.\n\nIt was heavenly: heaping portions, tasty and it totally hit the spot.\n\nWe couldn't wait to return.\n\nAnother Sunday we excitedly arrive at CL. I run up and check on the wait while the SO drives around looking for a space. \n\nHere is where everything goes left: I enter the restaurant and wait for a hostess or server to acknowledge me. One minute goes by, three minutes, then five, then almost ten. Staff whisks by and other patrons are seated. I finally see servers looking at me and discussing which one wants to serve me. No takers. More time goes by and more people are seated. Finally I give up and leave. Although I wish I had said something then, I just felt so bad. Hard to articulate yourself when you feel ignored and helpless. \n\nI called and spoke with the owner\/manager soon after. She was apologetic. \n\nIt's a recession and Cafe Lift has competition: Honey's, Sabrina's, etc. I patronize establishments that respect my time and money. I will NEVER pay to feel less than.

We get it, the little deli that's been there for 800 years that nobody can find is your favorite; their bread, the clientele, whatever it happens to be that draws you there you feel so hip by avoiding places like this and Wawa because they couldn't possibly assemble a decent sandwich. Look, this place is usually pretty good in my eyes they usually have fresh meats and cheese's and are able to construct a good sandwich.  Over the weekend i had my first meh experience at this location but previous meals make it at least a 3 star grade from me. Customer service is always on point, by complaint was with the wrap i ordered and the actual meat to lettuce ratio. I know they ask how i wanted the wrap (lettuce tomato onion mike's way??) and i said lettuce\/mayonnaise but someone translated that to \"extra lettuce, hold the turkey.\" The wrap had maybe two slices of turkey, i couldn't taste the cheese (even though i did see the lady slice it for me) and pulled out so much lettuce i could've grabbed some dressing and had a salad.

However, I did appreciate that we were all very well socially distanced from other tables. The waitress was very nice. We ordered the honey goat cheese, 1 sangria, and a slushie. I much preferred the slushie to the sangria. The slushies come in a variety of flavors so be sure to ask your waiter\/waitress what the daily flavors are. The portion sizes for the sangria and slushie were a lot smaller than I expected them to be. I regret not sampling their wine list. I personally did not care much for the honey and goat cheese, would probably order something else next time! The vineyards were off limits to letting us walk through them.

From the outset, she was prompt, professional, dedicated, hard working, never, EVER, said no or encountered a problem that she wasn't up to facing and figuring out a solution. I trust her like family and as a result, every ancillary person she brought from large item disposal to house cleaners, contractors to do small and minor repairs were highly professional, trusted, efficient and produced excellent quality work.  Her organizational, cleaning and staging skills are professional, tasteful and timely.  From the first meeting I knew she was capable but I didn't realize what a powerhouse she was until we encountered cleaning and disposing obstacles that she easily handled. She and her team worked tirelessly, well into the night on several occasions, came quickly when deadlines presented, worked weekends and nights to get the job done.  She went well beyond the call of duty in countless ways. We encountered many obstacles in the process but Sue never backed off from a challenge, was incredibly resourceful and was always available by phone or in person to help out. She even appeared in court for us during a dispute related to the home sale!!  \n\nI have nothing but the highest praise for her professionally and personally and continue to consult her for estate sale issues, home repair and service recommendations.

He is a nice guy who will kill you with kindness, but he knows when to whip out the nasty to get deals done.  \n\nEd provided great advice throughout the negotiation process.  I have to admit, at first I was skeptical when he told me to come in at a higher offer than what I wanted to start with.  In the end, I found out that there was another offer on the table that had a starting offer a few thousand less than mine.  If I had started any lower, I would have lost my dream home.  I still was able to get a great deal and apparently the other buyer is kicking themselves.\n\nWhat I liked about Ed the most was that he was constantly available via Gchat or phone.  I harrassed this poor guy with 20 questions\/day and he never seemed the least bit annoyed.  When I told him that my annoying mother wanted to see MORE pictures of the house ASAP he scooted over on a Saturday afternoon, took about 30 more pictures and sent them all to her.  In the final days of my closing when my mortgage company and appraiser were holding up the deal he was able to charm the appraiser into getting what we needed and wrote tough, no-nonsense emails to my mortgage company to get them to finalize the deal.\n\nEd will not only be your realtor, but he will be your advocate and friend.

My friend got the spicy szechuan soup and there was a lot of beef!! If you want to eat a lot of meat and like spicy food you should get that.\n\nI'd come back to try the other soup bases.","stars":4}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Nirvana has the best lunch buffet I've ever been to.  \n\nNormally I hate buffets and you'd have to tie me up and drag me to one.  I hate that some people don't know that when you go back up to the buffet line for seconds or thirds or what-have-you, you must get a new plate with each round, so you don't bring your germs back to the buffet line on your crusty plate filled with your disgusting saliva.  I hate the idea of food just sitting out for God knows how long, while people's faces and hands and germs are inches away from what I might eat.  I hate seeing sneeze guards because it just reminds me how many mouths and unsanitized hands have been near the food I'm about to eat.  And even if there are sneeze guards, that doesn't account for kids.  A few years ago my mom wanted to go to a Mother's Day Brunch at a hotel so we could meet our family members who have a couple of young kids.  I couldn't complain because it was for Mother's Day and we knew there would be something for everyone.  Well, I saw a short kid (neither of my cousins, thankfully) actually sneeze under the sneeze guard, and then go pack to picking at everything on the buffet line.  That completely ruined it for me.  I wanted to smack both that child and his mother.  But I held back.  Only because it was Mother's Day.  \n\nThere is a point to my rambling.\n\nNirvana is great because each of the three times I've been there for the buffet lunch, which were not well-attended any of the times, the other customers seemed to be savvy to the new-plate-for-each-round buffet etiquette.  Nirvana is also great because except for the salad and ginormous pudding bowl, the food isn't kept in a buffet trough.  Each dish has its separate container with securely attached lids.  Yes, I guess people can pass their germs when they open the lid, but the time that the food is exposed to the air is much less than just sitting out there for hours.  Finally, Nirvana is especially great, because most American children do not like Indian food, and I have never seen a single grubby kid step foot in there for buffet.\n\nThe buffet offers a nice variety of food.  I am not good with the Indian names, but I went with a picky friend who is a vegetarian and does not like spicy food, her father who will eat anything under the sun, and me who will eat anything under the sun that is not red meat.  Each time there was plenty of choices for each of us, and we always left stuffed and very happy.\n\nI've also been to Nirvana a couple times for dinner.   The servers are courteous, the food is prepared in a timely manner, and the table cloths are always clean.  The restaurant has a fair-sized bar, but one time for dinner and one time for lunch they were out of both Pinot Grigio and Riesling.  Chardonney is too dry for me, and I do not like red wine.  Oh well.\n\nIf you enjoy Indian food, and especially if you enjoy Indian buffets, Nirvana is a gem in the dump otherwise known as Wilmington.","stars":5}

If the line is all the way out to Market St (near the visitors center), you can expect it to take about 30 minutes to get to the building. NOTE: Once you get to the entrance of the building, there is NO MORE LINE. It is just an open exhibit that people can view at their own pleasure on their way to the bell. We thought once we got to the door that we were only halfway there, but we were pleasantly surprised to that the line was over. \n- As should be expected, the longer the line to get to the bell, the more people there will be crowding the bell.

After ordering drinks (The Afterthought cocktail should not be its namesake, don't hesitate to order that beauty), it took a while to get them and then an even longer time to get out waitress' attention to order. \n\nAmbience wise, this place is very trendy despite being inside a hotel. The restaurant is pretty dimly lit and there are a few types of tables with different seating options like couch loungers. It seems good for groups as well.\n\nFor dinner, I had the Bronzino with roasted vegetables. It's a whole fish, but you  have the option of removing the head when served, which I requested. It was really buttery and rich. I couldn't finish it because I am not used to that amount of butter. The roasted veggies were pretty oily as well. My friend had the ahi tuna appetizer and a Brussel sprout salad as her dinner and she liked it. \n\nAll in all, there are very few options for vegetarians, and some of the fish items even have bacon grease, so it's even tough for pescatarians.

My boyfriend put it really well when he said that Fare is like a track home of restaurants. There are some good elements, but overall, it's just not somewhere I want to be. The bar space is decorated really well and has potential, as well as the wall decorated with birch trees. But, the rest of the space is disjointed and has no comfortable appeal at all. On top of that, the music was awful and unfitting. \n\nThe place was packed today when I headed over with two others after finishing a 15K. It was full of runners wearing their medals, and was busier than I have ever seen it while walking by during brunch hours. We snagged the last tall table available in the bar, and received very 2-star service the entire time. Granted, they didn't seem used to having a full house, but it was almost 10 minutes before they took our drink order. The food that sounded so enticing on the menu was good, but not great. I split the tofu scramble and the breakfast burrito with my boyfriend. The scramble was good, but could have used more spices, although the tempeh bacon was a nice touch. The burrito could have been killer, but it was on a wheat tortilla (boo!), and was swimming in its own juices, making it super soggy! It had some good ingredients, but didn't leave me with any wow factor. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast home fries and received a basket of french fries instead. We were never checked on to see how our meals were. A different person than our original server dropped off a check and then no one returned to our table for 20 whole minutes. It was laughable the amount of times we tried to wave at someone or stare them down, only to be ignored.

My second encounter with The Pop Shop, I was actually able to sample the food. It wasn't a store but their food truck.

Everything for the kids was prepared exactly how we requested. The wife and I ordered grilled cheese sandwiches, and tomato soup. I ordered mine on sourdough with tomato and bacon. I didn't expect much because...its a grilled cheese sandwich...however I was slightly impressed on how well it was composed. \n\nI read some of the other reviews regarding how the food was not seasoned, etc. This place is designed for kids, so in my opinion the lack of various seasoning is a good thing and safer to keep it basic.

{"region":"EAST","text":"If I could give zero stars, I would!\n\nIt has taken me 2 years, yes 2, to finally write this review. I'm still disappointed and disgusted with what happened during my visits at this hair studio in January 2017. \n\nI had been dealing with hair breakage due to over processed hair due to too much bleaching. I knew that Fresh was a very well known and high end, reputable salon, which is why I chose to call them and set up an appointment to help with my hair concerns.\n\nI went in and met with Chrissy, who was a platinum blonde herself and was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable. I explained to her my situation. I had currently had a shadow root with dark roots transitioning to blonde down the shaft and to the ends.  I explained that there was a halo of brass around the darker color (about an inch from my scalp) and I was just looking for a way to cool that brass down. I was told by my previous hairdresser not to bleach the hair for awhile as my hair was very fragile. I told Chrissy this information and also showed her some breakage that had occurred already on my head. As Chrissy took a look at my current hair, she made her recommendation. She expressed that my hair did not look too damaged or broken and that she felt the best bet was for me to get back to all blonde, platinum. She told me that trying to fix just the brassy halo around my head would be very tedious and it would be better to go blonde. She seemed pretty confident, and I trusted her as the professional. This is my biggest regret. \n\nI scheduled my appointment for a few days later on a Friday afternoon. The process took about 3 hours. I never did get a blow dry before I left, but we'll get to that.  Chrissy and I had text each other back and forth a few times beforehand and she and I were both excited. Being platinum was what I truly wanted. After the 3 hours of foils and the dryer and more products etc etc I sat down in Chrissy's chair. To start, my roots were bright orange. I mentioned this and Chrissy said she didn't want to put anymore chemicals on my hair at the moment since it just went through the 3 hour process. She told me that I could come back in a week and she would try to put something on it to lighten it a bit more. So there I was, with fire crotch roots. Also, she began drying a tiny piece of my hair and then said she felt my hair was a bit fragile at this point and didn't want to put any heat on it. She told me to let it air dry and I left with a wet head.\nI went down the shore that weekend with friends from college. I had my hair pulled back until the following day when I showered again. After showering, this is when I realized the horror!!!\nI went to brush my hair, and realized that I literally had bangs that were about a half inch long. The ENTIRE CRADLE of my hair on my head was GONE! FRIED! \nI literally almost had a panic attack. I could not believe what I saw... or didn't see. My hair was WRECKED! I immediately text Chrissy and she said she did not notice any breakage during the processing. I find this extremely hard to believe because every single hairdresser whom I have told about this experience says that there is NO WAY she did not know before I left that salon.\nI asked her about my options. Literally asked about wigs, extensions etc. I couldn't walk around in public like this. \nI literally had sessions with my therapist discussing how traumatized I was about my hair and how embarrassed I was to leave my house, go to work, etc.\nThe best Chrissy offered me at first was 6 months of treatments to help my hair grow. That did NOTHING for my current issue, that I never even asked for!\nI finally asked for a refund and Chrissy talked to her manager and they agreed to refund my money. When I went to the salon to pick up the refund, a manager came from behind the desk and handed me my $196 and said \"sorry it didn't work out,\" and then walked away. No one even offered to take a look at the aftermath of extremely over processed, burned off hair! I felt very mistreated by the management. She didn't care at all about my situation.\nI went into work a few days later crying to colleagues and wondering what I was going to do to mask this mess. I was referred to a stylist in Newtown who specialized in blondes as well as in extensions. She literally saved my life. She fit me in in a pinch, and was able to tone down the orange and put in some very thin extensions to try to somewhat compensate for my non existent hair. I have had to pay thousands of dollars over the last 2 years to have extensions because my hair is still not back to what it was when I stepped into Fresh Hair Studio that day with Chrissy.","stars":1}

{"region":"EAST","text":"I had a very bad first impression of this store and I won't be back because of my first experience. I came in to mail an item and asked if I buy an envelope at the mailing center or from the actual store. The associate Harrison said we buy it in the store and then can come back to the kiosk to pay for it and ship the item. When we came over with the envelope he was assisting another customer which was fine as we had no problem waiting. He looks at us and says that we can go to the cash register and pay for the envelope. He said it with an arrogant tone which made me reply that he told us to come back over here since we need to ship out the item. It didn't make sense to walk across the store, wait in line, pay for the item and then walk all the way back especially since he told us we could do it with him. By the time we walked back from the line, he could have been helping a second costumer so it didn't make sense to do that. When I explained that we were going to stay and wait because we needed to ship out, he paused as if he wanted to say something rude and then said, \"okay\" with a tone that showed he was annoyed. When we're shipping out the item he begins talking to another associate telling her to make sure no one bothers him because he has work to do in the back. He paused our transaction to have this conversation with her and then leaves and tells the girl to get out receipt because he needs to the job in the back because he is the only one who can do it. \n\nI felt that this associate was unprofessional because of this reasons and because of him and his attitude, I won't be back in this store.","stars":1}

Week #2 of 6\/29\/20 this shop closes for a whole week. Week #3 of 7\/6\/20, this shop keeps giving my insurance adjuster the run around. The owner of modern auto crafter is a dirty crook. He kept saying he will send pictures of the damage to my insurance company to ultimately telling them that he's too busy. 3 weeks of holding my car and nothing happens. Week #4 of 7\/13\/20, I was fed up and beg my insurance company tow my car to another autobody which they did. Final straw was the owner refuses to release because my insurance company did not pay fees associate with storage of my car. What a bunch of crooks. They held my car for weeks without fixing my car and refusing to let me take my car out of their shop. After much headaches, Modern Auto Crafters release my car. They are crooks. I later found out that Modern Auto Crafters will hold your car as long as possible regardless of fix it or not so They can collect storages fees billed to you or your insurance company.\n\n Beware, you have been warned.","stars":1}

{"region":"EAST","text":"We recently got a takeout order here. They serve Krispy Krunchy Chicken - which is usually found at gas station locations across the country.  It's supposedly Cajun chicken but it's not that spicy, so if you like a little kick, I suggest grabbing your favorite hot sauce. They also have fried fish and shrimp on the menu, which we will probably try on our next visit. The full menu is on their website. \n\nWe got some chicken tenders and waffles along with mashed potatoes and gravy, red beans and rice, Mac n cheese, potato wedges and honey biscuits. The tenders were pretty good, a little dry on the ends but that's probably because most of the chicken sits under heat lamps. If they're willing to fry them fresh, we would certainly wait next time. We paired them with honey mustard and the bbq sauces, which were tasty. The waffles were pretty yummy with a dusting of powdered sugar and a side of warm syrup. As for the sides, we will probably get the mac n cheese, potato wedges and biscuits again and maybe try out the jambalaya but the mashed potatoes were a bit thin for our liking and we didn't care much for the flavor of the red beans and rice. \n\nThey also serve various flavors of ice cream and toppings to make waffle sundaes, which we look forward to trying when the weather warms up a bit. \n\nOverall, we're happy to have a fried chicken spot in town ever since KFC closed down last year. I think they would benefit from doing some in-home advertising with a menu\/coupons like a lot of the local businesses do, because we probably wouldn't have known this was here if we didn't drive by in the shopping center. We will definitely return when the craving hits again.","stars":4}

Not realizing that it was for the thin- crusted pizza, we ordered the mega crust. The customer service reps were well into completing our toppings when the manager, at this point in time, decided to research the advertised specials, came back and said , no we couldn't have the pizzas and that the offer was for \" mod\" pizza. At this point they took our pizzas and put them on the side where they probably ended up in the trash.\n\nWhat would it have meant if the manager could have let us have the original pizzas that were topped by their hard- working staff?  No, they had to start over on the thin crust pizza.\n\nSometimes customer service is so important in fostering good customer relations and repeat business.

I'm very picky with food - that is, I like high-quality, simply-prepared, yet delicious foods.

My aunt and uncle shared the creme brulee french toast, my parents shared the California turkey panini, and my brother finished the steak and eggs by himself. As for me, I chose the root vegetable benedict, sans the brioche and sub potatoes with a side salad. To be honest, I was underwhelmed by my order. Even though the eggs were poached well, there was way too much oil in the roasted veggies and side salad. Ultimately, it really detracted from the dish itself.

I told him I needed to pay my bill and he pointed to the back so I went back and another gentleman had earbuds on sitting on a chair at a high top table, he didn't say anything so I said I would like to pay my bill and he said cash or credit, I said cash and he quickly responded it has to be exact change. I said I guess I can pay extra. He pointed to a kiosk. I went and started paying my bill at the self-serve kiosk. I said I thought I could pay a human at the back counter and he said yeah you could. Then a third male employee comes out from the back and greeted me appropriately. At this time there were no customers and three employees in the store. The kiosk made you enter the amount of the payment but then ignored the amount you enter and took my 20's that had to be put in 1 at a time, not very convenient. I have been an AT&T customer since before it was called AT&T. What has happened to customer service? the guy that said no change never got off his stool. Maybe they should stop having commissioned employees or have managers that manage. I would have rathered there be no employees but a 24-hour kiosk. Guess these people have no vested interest and don't see the future when their job is replaced by machines. The money I pay to AT&T each month is almost $200.00.

My boyfriend drank the Yards beer special and I had several of the Rose sangrias... not too sweet and fairly strong. We ordered several rounds of chicken and carnitas tacos--so good! Flavors were fresh, interesting and authentic. Tacos were bigger and more full than the $2 happy hour tacos you get at some other places. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and the wait staff operates as a team so plenty of other servers stopped by to grab us more food & drinks, refill water, bus dishes, etc. The place was packed by 6:45 when we got up to leave.

{"region":"EAST","text":"As a loyal yelper, I first reviewed it on here before I ever thought of actually going in for dinner. The reviews seemed generally positive, as I was looking for a nice BYOB specifically. Here is a simplified version of my thoughts:\n\nDecor: Not important when it comes to dining, I mostly care about the food but this is a discussion point for many others on yelp so I'll throw it in. Small, plain white walls, with buckets of apples for decorations. Kitchen is in the back of the open room, totally visible. Beautiful and very clean bathroom!\n\nService: Less than 5 waiters\/hosts, but they got the job done. We were greeted nicely and service was great. Waitress was always there when we needed her and was very kind during our meal. \n\nFood: The important one. \n\nAppetizers- \nFig\/gorgonzola flatbread (not great, quite thin and not memorable)\nRoasted asparagus with feta (not memorable either, small portion)\nButternut squash soup ( i really liked this! i've had better, but this one was great too. generous portion!)\n\nMeal- I had read about the pomegranate molasses chicken and the pork chop on yelp. I went with the pork chop. It wasn't nearly what it was cracked up to be...the menu described it as \"maple brined, wild boar bacon, with gorgonzola and apple butter sauce\". The serving size was very generous! But, I didn't taste any maple. The butter was just on the top of the pork chop, but it was very tall in height and smaller diameter (similar to how a filet mignon looked). Being that the butter was only the top surface, there wasnt enough to distribute to the whole chop and it was quite flavorless. Beautiful cut of meat though. The apples and bacon were great on each bite, and the asparagus and mashed potatoes were very tasty. \n\nThe other members of the party had sole, salmon, and chicken milanese. They were happy with their choice, not disappointed, but one person we dined with was a great cook and we all agreed that his food was better than we had that night.\n\nOverall, great service, great atmosphere, but the food was not very memorable. I still recommend to give it a try though! I don't think I'll be back, just because there are too many other places in Philly to try!","stars":3}

First I go in 9 months ago to see about a problem I am having with a bridge they put in my mouth 6 years ago and they tell me the whole bridge has to come out and the tooth that is holding the bridge is decayed. Then a few minutes later they come up with a bill of 4500. Then I go to my dentist for a 2nd opinion and he tells he does not know why UD put the bridge over the tooth in the first place. Unfortunately my insurance doesn't cover cosmetic surgery so I go back to this place after a few months. I am told when I make the appointment that since I was coming in to discuss getting the procedure done that was discussed last visit there would be no cost just set up treatment-lie They took more xrays and then come to me with a bill of 8700 almost double of what originally stated. Why would more work need to be done when nothing has changed? Then they tell me their prices went up. I felt like I was buying a car not having dental work as the doctor left the room and had his assistant go over everything. No thanks!

The restaurant was small but on a Sunday at noon, we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table (maybe we were just lucky).

The home fries were scattered on my plate and did not look like they were a full serving.  I would recommend they use smaller plates, since everyone's food looked like the portions were too small.  \n\nAnyway, the service was so unbelievably terrible that I would never come back or recommend this place.  Our server was fine, and at a certain point it wasn't his fault, but when the kitchen is backed up (or loses or order.... who knows what happened!) and the server started to avoid us, that's when I start to get annoyed!  It took over 40 minutes for our simple BREAKFAST food to come out of the kitchen.  How could you be anything but disappointed then?\n\nThe server didn't apologize, no manager or owner came over to explain anything... so I'm thinking this is the norm for here?

The sushi rolls and sashimi was fresh and pretty good. Had some appetizers as well including miso soup, seafood soup, Gyoza and fried tofu. All came out pretty well and definitely got my money's worth in the rolls alone. \n\nThe service was good but there were only a few other tables around. The servers didn't really speak English so it was a bit difficult to ask any questions.

Highly recommended for breakfast or brunch!!!\n\nLocation Details: We came here mid-day on a Saturday, and it was fairly packed (it probably only fits about 20 people inside) for an old train station stop. We had a hard time finding it as it is not on the main street in Fort Washington, its actually at the current SEPTA train stop. There are only a few parking spots, but on the weekends you can park in the SEPTA parking lot (which is huge) and cross under the tracks to the restaurant (we did this).\n\nThe food (and drink): Not a huge beverage selection, but the coffee is excellent and comes with these cute spoons that rest on the side of the cup. No Soy \/ almond milk though for my lactose intolerant husband's coffee :(. So my husband had the duck sausage with Brussels sprouts and fried eggs (this was amazing!, BTW I am biased because I love Brussels sprouts), later we heard they ran out of Brussels sprouts, so you might need to order this dish early. I had the fried chicken sandwich with a side of potato salad. The fried chicken had the most amazing seasoning, and could just be a dish on its own! I wouldn't order the side of potato salad again though, it wasn't bad, but nothing special (I'd be interested to try the other side options of fries or Cole slaw). Both our dishes were delicious and from seeing the plates come out of the kitchen, there are a ton of other dishes that I would like to try. \n\nService: I'd say it was average, not bad, not great. I'm a bit of a coffee fiend so having a routinely filled cup is important to me at breakfast and there were some dry cup periods of time. Other than that they didn't hover or disappear completely, which is what I normally look for in service.\n\nOverall: We are definitely coming back as this is one of the few excellent breakfast restaurants we've found outside of Philly.","stars":5}

I have even brought several of my mom's cats here after they had been receiving inferior treatment elsewhere and now those pets are healthy and thriving. One cat had severe mouth ulcers and gingivitis which was not responding to the medications another vet had prescribed. He was near to dying from starvation when I brought him in for emergency care. Dr. Collier kept him on medications and close observation for several months, did a full dental extraction and now the cat is healthy, happy and regaining weight. Another young kitten I brought in had a severe eye ulcer which another vet would only treat by removing the eye. Dr. Magazu performed a procedure which allowed the kitten to keep the eye and retain most of his vision. \n\nI also appreciate that while surgery expenses are high (similar to other facilities), follow-up check up appointments are not expensive. \n\nMy one quibble is I have sometimes had difficulty getting results back from diagnostic testing without repeated calls trying to chase down staff.

I was able to take frozen meals home to feed my family of four (I grabbed the chicken pit pie and it was delicious).  \nI met my friend there for lunch. She had the chicken salad on croissant with a side of their homemade potato chips (yum) and I had a chicken quesadillas with their homemade tortillas chips (double yum).

{"region":"EAST","text":"This is a great place to go to dinner if you don't know what you're craving. Barbuzzo's menu has many different options to whet your appetite. A dinner for two with drinks can run you almost $100 since it's small plates ranging from $3-$17 each. If you go after 10:30pm Sunday through Thursday, you can get their late night dinner and drinks specials though!\n\nFood -- I think almost everything is delicious here. I really like the cheese board and what's really great is that on the board is a strip of paper that tells you the name of each cheese. Most other places has you guessing what it is you are putting in your mouth or the waitress goes through the different cheeses so fast that your head spins. I also recommend the pizza which is probably the best bang for your buck. If you are looking for something fancier, the fois gras is rich and creamy and paired perfectly with the apple marmalade on top.\n\nService -- Everyone is really nice and friendly. I never feel rushed but at the same time, the service is extremely efficient so you never feel like you've been waiting for a long time either. \n\nAtmosphere -- Don't get me wrong, I like outdoor seating as much as the next person but eating dinner at night on the small 13th Street sidewalk with some 10+ people walking by at any given time and cars driving past kicking up dust from the street isn't very hygenic or enjoyable. Eating inside isn't much better, with the very small walkway leading to the bathroom in the back and tables practically on top of each other. The dim lighting doesn't help one maneuver easier either. I understand that commercial space is limited on that street and getting as many people in will decrease lines and increase revenue, but sometimes less (tables) is more. I would rather wait to get a 5-star experience than feel packed in like a can of sardines and that's why Barbuzzo only got 4-stars from me.\n\nOverall, I love the food but I really wish Marcie Turney and Valerie Safran had put Barbuzzo in a larger space (possibly switch with Jamonera).","stars":4}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Saw Honey's on Triple D so we had to come over and try it. Parking's a bit of a pain, of course, but I don't care about a good walk. \n\nWe came in a half hour after they opened, nice and early. We were told it starts to get busy around 9, so I'm glad to have beaten the crowd. We were seated right away and server came to take our order. Naturally, we like to try a bunch of different things at a new spot so it was difficult to make some decisions.\n\nThere was homemade strawberry jam on the table. It was fresh and really yummy. And their orange juice is homemade too, you can watch them make it behind the bar. One of their specials was Honey Bun Pancakes..cinnamon pancakes with pecan brittle butter and honey caramel syrup, and I just had to have it, but I wanted Eggs Benedict too!! Luckily, my boyfriend wanted the Honey Platter which is three pancakes, two eggs, choice of meat and potato or grits..so we were able to substitute the regular pancakes for the Honey Bun Pancakes. Because of the platter, the pancakes were much smaller than what a full order of the Honey Bun Pancakes would be (I just like saying Honey Bun Pancakes.) I ordered my Eggs Benedict over challah bread with cayenne spiced hollandaise. Bummer, I really couldn't taste much of the cayenne, but it was still good, rather small though, considering the price without it's own side. I got a side of potato latke, which was great. It was nice and thick and had a lot of flavor, really good! We also got a side of biscuits and sausage gravy, also good. Big biscuits and big bits of sausage. Grits were ok, but I'm not a huge fan to begin with. Now for the Honey Bun Pancakes. YUM. They were fluffy, the pecan brittle butter was soo good. I didn't need syrup, until I ran out of pancake without the butter. And it wasn't overly sweet.\n\nThey are also vegetarian friendly with a few options that sounded rather good, and use free range eggs. \n\nEverything is made from scratch. You can see and taste it in the food. All in all, this is a great breakfast spot. The place is small, so I could only imagine long lines out the door at it's busier times, so I'll definitely want to come again pretty early for breakfast, but I have to come back for lunch now too. \n\nIt's also BYOB, Cash Only & No Reservations!","stars":4}
{"region":"EAST","text":"Wow, so disappointing. First of all, the woman who took my order on the phone was very nice but spoke with such a thick accent it was impossible to understand a word she said. I ordered wonton soup and beef with string beans, which she apparently misunderstood completely because what I got was sauteed string beans. She repeated the order at the end of the phone call but she might as well have been speaking Norweigen for how much of what she said I was able to understand. I was in a hurry and I didn't have time to have the order re-done so  I just took it. This means I paid $8.50 for a pile of string beans I could have gotten for 99 cents at Tanners, but that's my fault for not making them re-do the order. The real problem was everything was bland and utterly tasteless. I couldn't finish any of it and I will definitely not be going back. Very disappointing.","stars":1}

We arrived at 11:30 when it was still not busy but as it got more crowded we were asked whether we could keep the kids quiet as other customers were arriving. Its not like we weren't trying to keep our kids quiet but they are ages 2 and 3!  Our 2 year old has a loud voice but the kids were by no means out of control.

Green Medley has the freshest and healthiest ingredients by far out of all of the places in the food court. This is a must for vegan and vegetarians. My favorite dish is the arugala and mango salad which is seasonal and I hope it makes a come back in the summer. The first couple of times I ate from here I didn't even realize it was vegetarian. The chicken salad is very good and I think is better than any traditional chicken salad that I have had. There is all kinds of stuff in the chicken salad which together makes a great taste. And the best part is you can get any order in either a salad, wrap or sandwich. The prices are on par with Salad Works, and I find this place much more interesting with nicer employees than Salad Works.

{"region":"EAST","text":"What can one say?  Based on prior experience, the bar for kosher restaurants is kind of low. The dishes are typically pedestrian & the service has been universally abominable, but C&R is a Michael Salamanov location & he knows how to run a restaurant.\n\nThe menu is an inventive twist on traditional Eastern European Jewish foods. We had the steak tartare with bone marrow nuggets and celery root soup with stuffed cabbage. For entrees, there was roast chicken, braised lamb shank and seared tuna. I'd like to say they executed flawlessly, they were almost universally over salted. It almost seemed as if the recipes were developed without regard to the fact that it was kosher meat (which is salted as part of the process). \n\nAll in all, a great place & kosher to boot. I'm not kosher, my wife and many of our friends are. C&R provides a great opportunity for us to go out without them tiptoe-ing thru the menu for meatless dishes.

Dark and red lighting, light Latin tunes, and your food is served with an accent, por supuesto! \n\nThe service was excellent. Our reserved table wasn't ready at its reserved time so we were offered complimentary tacos. These tacos were EVERYTHING. A perfect way to set the stage to an amazing meal. But more about the food later, back to the service. Never an empty glass, and if you excused yourself, you'd find your napkin folded nicely on your seat. Really top-notch service.\n\nThe drinks were awesome. Most people in my group tried the classic Cuban choice- a mojito. I opted for the Caipirinha. Another person was more experimental. We were all very satisfied and couldn't be stopped to try second and third rounds! \n\nThe food was wonderful! I can't say that it is truly authentically, \"Cuban,\" but everything has some element of Latin flare. I hesitantly ordered paella, and I'll tell you I am a paella snob, and I like it the authentic Galician way (seafood only). If i closed my eyes, I could have been in Spain. It was really very well done, something hard to master. Others tried the scallops and the chicken and we were all drooling over each others dishes. We also all shared 2 types of empanadas which were unique but amazing. The presentation was beautiful and everything was so tasty. \n\nThe desert is definitely worth splurging for if you're not stuffed! Most opt for the Chocolate Cigar, which I tasted and it is surely decadent and lives up to its gold wrapper. I tried the coconut tapioca pudding. This is the coolest dessert, and possibly the coolest thing I've ever ordered at any restaurant!! \n\nI can't wait to take another trip to Philly so that I can go back! \u00a1Una experiencia incre\u00edble!!!","stars":5}

No food for us and the wrong food for them!  Nicely done!  \n\nObviously they were sorry for the mixup and we had them re-do the order. A half an hour later we got our food.  My wife asked for a discount for our trouble but all they would do is give us a complimentary Spring Roll.  We took the food home and were thoroughly disappointed.  The wonton soup broth was bland but the wontons were very spicy with an objectionable taste.  The Spring Roll was terrible!  The Egg Roll was very bland.  The Pork Fried Rice was not so fried.  Basically white rice with some pieces of pork thrown in.  The Sweet and sour shrimp was not properly deveined!  Disgusting! \n\nAfter twenty years of patronage at a rather pricey Chinese Restaurant it's time to look for a better solution.  I can get bad chinese food at half the price almost anywhere.

All of these restaurants are quick, pretty cheap, mostly friendly, and always delicious. \n\nThe menus are usually much larger than a more traditional mexican restaurant. Tons of traditional items, tons of traditional tex-mex staples and combo platters, and tons of specialties as well. Their food is always well cooked, arrives hot, and super quick. Most items involve lots of sauce and lots of cheese, so dieters do not beware. Just stay away. :) Don't forget they have a bar with cheap drinks too! Usually good drink specials on Mondays and Wednesdays too? I have tried many items and really liked all, but especially the Puntas al Albanil, and seafood burritos\/enchiladas. I highly recommend going for lunch, because their lunch entrees are like 5-8 dollars and still ginormous. Why is spell check telling me ginormous is a word? Scary. The skinny is that their guac, when served with an entree or ordered a small (premade) side, is not great. I noticed a newer menu had table-side guac on it, but haven't tried it yet. \n\nAnyway, I really do have a soft spot for this place. It is NOT super authentic, but it is not Taco Bell either.

The three other meals were Raman bowls and they were terrible. When expressed to management they said we cannot take off bill because you ate some. Wasn't the point. Lots of empty \"I am sorry\" statements but really did not care nor acknowledge any of the feedback. Bought a pizza to go because all of us were starving and sorry to say we will never be back. Disappointed as generally good experience the other times we have been there but when management and servers don't actually care about the quality of the food or experience it generally means the place is trending in a bad direction.","stars":1}

Granted, the diner is on the smaller side, but I still find that impressive. They could do a better job cleaning and brightening up the place, but overall it was nice. There were a few flies and fruit flies, though.\n\nThe owner, our waitress, and all the staff members I interacted with were such gracious hosts and made me feel at home. Everything was timely.\n\nA dollar goes a long way here. I ordered a dinner special, corned beef with cabbage, and it came with soup, salad, and dessert, all for about $11. My dad got chicken marsala for around $10 and it came with soup and salad as well.\n\nTheir salad wasn't very impressive. They weren't consistent with the ingredients; my dad had carrots and I didn't. It's a lot of lettuce and a few other garden salad vegetables, and it tasted like something I'd throw together. The ingredients were all fresh, however.\n\nBoth their split pea and chicken noodle soups were good. The salt level was pretty decent, and they brought saltines to go with it. The soups were full of flavor.\n\nMy entr\u00e9e was pretty large. Two quarter wedges of cabbage and a boiled potato were topped with a generous amount of corned beef. I enjoyed everything. The beef was a little sour and barely salty, which let the flavor of the beef shine through. The cabbage was tender and buttery. My dad's chicken marsala was also a generous portion. Unlike other versions, the chicken was cooked in slices. I enjoyed the flavors. He also ordered a baked potato and mixed vegetables as sides. The potato came with two cups full of sour cream. I would have liked some butter. Also, the vegetables came in a tiny dish and I'm not sure if they were fresh.\n\nI ordered some cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. The flavors seemed very artificial to me, and it was getting soft and melty when I got it.\n\nThe food here is closer to 3 stars, but the friendly service and great prices bump it up to 4.","stars":4}

Our meals- veal w\/ prosciutto for me, veal w\/ seafood for the lady- were \"OK\"- not very flavorful, and not the best veal ever (nor the worst). The side potatoes were nice and crispy, but needed salt. Not $25\/plate culinary experiences. Dessert was a slice of ricotta cheesecake off the huge cart, which would have been pretty good except that it cost $10 and should have cost maybe $6, tops. Cappuccino was good but cups were rather small.\n\nAmbiance-wise, the dining room is pretty nice, though it's wide-open so when the loudmouths two tables down talk, (or they turn up the ballgame on the bar TV) you hear it loud and clear. Also, the entry door to the dining room is closed- you're routed past the bar (with flatscreen tv) on the way in and out, which doesn't scream \"fine dining\" to me. Also, no musicians or music.

I find the food to be bland and not very exciting. All the sushi tastes the same to me but my daughter loves it. The food isn't super hot but it's not ice cold either. Much of it is greasy but if you're selective you can minimize the grease intake. The service is pretty good too. Like i said, it's a buffet so it is what it is.\n\nPrice wise it isn't bad. Five of us ate for 75 bucks before tip. They also offer a 5 percent cash discount but make sure you mention it when you pay because they always \"forget\".\n\nTry to avoid the restroom if you can. The floor is slimy and the fixtures are just generally gross.

It blows my mind how far off some of the Chinese-but-not-strictly-Cantonese dishes are from what they traditionally should be.

It is in a new building it shares with an as yet unleased commercial space. It is not the roadhouse a diner was designed to be. \n\nStill, the menu looked diner. So, what the heck. I was ready for breakfast, and I was already there, and in the hunt for some good french toast. That they had in abundance, although not just the plain egg bread fried with the hint of vanilla and sugar I was hankering for. But, when I asked the friendly server if it was available, she assured me it was. \n\nThe coffee was strong, hot and free flowing. The main attraction was disappointing. It looked great on the plate, especially after melting some butter and running syrup over it. But, upon cutting and first bite, found its insides to be mushy and cooler than the surface. It wasn't eggy inside as you might expect, but almost watery, like the mix had been diluted to the point where it lacked the hen seed to thicken under heat. It just stayed wet. The flavor was about right, but texture counts, too. \n\nI suppose I could have given it back to them for another try, but wasn't feeling like making that scene. I ate what I could and took my leave. Just glad I hadn't asked for the heavy hitters on the menu, which would have put a bigger dent in my wallet.\n\nIt was probably a mistake that wasn't caught before reaching its final destination, but first impressions were damaging.","stars":2}

There was a friendly guy in his thirties on the piano playing and singing just about everything, from Sinatra to Sweet Caroline to contemporary hits. \n\nThey have a lounge area just inside with a bar and some casual seating, and two separate dining rooms (what I could see, anyway), as well as that outdoor patio that was not open for the season quite yet.  \n\nThe food.  Bread with olive oil? Great. Ceasar salad? Just OK.  Seared Ahi Tuna? Pretty good! Entrees - had the penne with chicken and bruschetta in a garlic olive oil sauce.  I'm not sure what they did to the chicken, but whatever they do, they should change it.  I think it was boiled.  Grill that chicken and season it!  Overkill on the sauce as well.  Others with us had the scallops and enjoyed them.  I think someone else said this - the menu seems above the abilities of the cooks.\n\nThe food wasn't BAD, it just wasn't GREAT.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I've stayed here for about 3 weeks now, and will probably be here for potentially one more for work. I do feel like the hotel is well maintained, and as previous yelpers have specified, the staff at the front desk is very friendly and cordial. \n\nAlso similar to what prior posts have indicated, the housekeeping staff is very aggressive to get in and out in the mornings - and you can tell they are held to a high standard not only for time spent per floor\/room but for quality of clensliness in rooms. The pro of this is that the rooms are always very well maintained. The cons is that they are not quiet in the AM at all. In fact, one of the male housekeeping staff uses the latch on the door to keep the door open so he doesn't continually have to key-card-open it, and it bangs and reverberates all the way down the hallway. This morning I could hear one of the supervisors yelling room numbers to another one that still need to be completed. If you are an early bird and get out in time, then this is probably never gong to be a concern. If you tend to work later in the day, or want to sleep in on a day off, good luck getting quality sleep.\n\nThe last complaint I have is that the breakfast in the morning is sub par. I usually only want a bagel and yogurt, but I have regularly found that the bagels are stale, and the yogurt to be gone. They clearly manage their food inventory closely for this to be the case. I'm just disappointed because when I compare it to other similarly priced hotels I have stayed at for business - It does not stack up at all.\n\nOverall, a very nice and clean hotel.

On August 10th, we were traveling from Ohio to Long Island, NY for my father's upcoming birthday and for another party, so I decided to surprise my wife with a night at this charming Pennsylvania inn.  She LOVED it.  So did I. The house and the grounds are amazing, the room was fantastic (we stayed in June Moon, which is large, with a raised full bed and a bathroom with a whirlpool bath and multi-head shower), and the attention to detail cannot be overstated.  The owners, Mark and his wife, Dina, were perfect hosts and went out of their way to make sure we were happy with everything.  We had our anniversary dinner in the quaint dining room and everything was delicious.  They even sat us at a romantic table for 2 at the window with a great view of the patio. Our server was a young guy (looked a little like Tom Cruise -- the younger version) who had a great attitude and provided us with a 5-star dining experience.  In the morning we were treated to a sumptuous breakfast by the owner and by the chef, Drew, who shared chef stories and discussed chef stuff with my wife, who also happens to be a chef.   We ended up having a 2-hour breakfast to complete our perfect stay.  The inn has a pool, a goat, some ponies and a large barn with more rooms -- all situated on 30 acres.  \nIt is also very near the Mercer Museum, Fonthill Castle (also Mercer), and the Moravian Tile Works (also Mercer) plus the balloon rides.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend the Inn at Barley Sheaf Farm.

{"region":"EAST","text":"How this place has only one other review, I will never know.  It seems like Rita's is a hidden gem.  And if it is, it's a rare, shiny one that should be illuminated before the whole world!\n\nDo not underestimate the goodness of this humble Italian ice stand.  The fruit ices taste like sorbets; some of them even have fruit chunks in them (example, pina colada has chunks of real pineapple!).  An oldie but goodie for me is the mango water ice...if you have ever fallen in love with Haagen Daaz mango sorbet, the mango water ice will seduce your taste buds.  Other examples of fruit include lemonade, Florida orange, blue raspberry, kiwi strawberry, and wild black cherry.\n\nFor those craving something sugary sweet, Rita's offers cream ice (which I have yet to try...I have heard it's similar to regular ice cream, but not quite as much fat).\n\nTo fully indulge in Rita's however, I believe one must have the gelati.  Basically it's the best of Rita's two best: the water ice and the frozen custard.  Frozen vanilla (or at least it's usually vanilla...flavors are really starting to branch out) custard tops off your water ice flavor of choice, and at the bottom of the cup, more frozen custard greets you and leaves you with a heavenly bliss in your very fortunate mouth.\n\nBeing from the West Coast, I simply have to come here every time I go to visit family who lives out in this area.  It's a family tradition that every one finds enjoyable and satisfying.\n\nRIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAA''''''''SSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

{"region":"EAST","text":"I contracted with Power to replace my roof -- I had two layers of shingles on my house and three on my garage. While the sales process was much longer than I would have liked, it wasy *very* informative and gave me a lot of information on how Power was different than their competitors and what to look out for if I chose a different contractor. \n\nPower arrived on installation day as planned, but had to delay 1 day due to bad weather. Regardless, they still replace the entire roof in a single day as promised, and did a great job repairing some bad rafters as expected. Power did a fair bit fo replacement on the roof boards themselves, and it was all done professionally and without complaint.\n\nAfter they were done I found a fair bit of tar paper, nails, and other debris, but no more than I expected given the work involved.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Power and plan to use them again in the future for siding or other work. They were definitely a higher cost than other contractors, but I was swayed by the quality of their work, the quality of the materials, and the fact that they promised to have enough crew to complete the job in a single day -- a very welcome bonus!!\n\nI will say that the sales presentation was long and drawn-out (it could have been much shorter), and the post-installation review was also largely a sales presentation, but given the quality of the work I didn't mind too much.","stars":4}

I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door and every one was pleasant. There were 4 people working and there was a slow but steady business for the entire time I was there. It's $27 for a basic pedicure, which is at the low end of the $25-35 range that is typical for the area. \n\nHere is what I loved:\n1) No f***ing upsell. You look at the menu, you ask for what you want and that's it. There are places I've stopped going to because it's a continual string of people offering you something for \"just $5\" on top of what you've already asked for.\n2) They opened the sterile autoclave package of tools right in front of me. Perfect.\n3) They give you a hot stone massage and wrap your feet and legs in hot towels as part of the basic pedicure.\n4) The pedicurist gave me a 5 minute shoulder massage while my toes were drying! \n\nI'll definitely be back and I've already told two other people out this place. Great job guys!","stars":4}

Arancini balls are heaven in your mouth along with the mushroom gnocchi.  I liked the cauliflower agrodolce but it was slightly over cooked for some.  The chocolate dessert was great shared by all!\n\nNeeds improvement:  The mushroom risotto was okay, my friend wasn't impressed or wanting to go back for more.  The octopus appetizer was okay.  The portion was small and it didn't seem like the salad underneath really went with the octopus.  Our first server wasn't very attentive, knowing when we needed water or another beverage.

{"region":"EAST","text":"We use Enterprise frequently and have been very satisfied.  Our experience at this location, however, has been a nightmare.  When we picked up a car and did the routine check for damage, we spotted a scratch on the hood.  The agent told us that the scratch was not deep enough to be worth noting and that we should not even bother to report it on the contract.  When we returned our car, we were informed by the agents that the hood was damaged.  We thought they were talking about the scratch and immediately protested.  We were told by Enterprise that the scratch was not the issue, but that there was a large indentation on the hood (which they spotted  by squatting down to look at the hood at eye level). We had no idea what they were talking about because the damage was not visible even we were looking directly at it.  We have rented a lot of cars and we have never seen agents squat to look for damage on a hood.  It almost seemed like these agents were trained to do this and to pin damage on unsuspecting customers.  When we asked how the damage could have occurred, we were told that someone must have sat on the hood.  Since our car was parked either in a parking garage or in the parking lot of a hotel off the interstate while we rented it, this is highly unlikely.  Needless to say, we were outraged- especially after being charged $500 for the damage.  If any repair had to be done, it could have easily been done by tapping out the dent at minimal expense.  It now has been over a month and this still has not been resolved.  To make matters worse, when I called to find out about the status of the repairs I was told that Enterprise is also getting the scratch on the hood repaired, which I am sure they will hold us liable for even though we were told twice that the scratch was not a problem.  Luckily, we paid for the car with a credit card that will cover all damages and not require us to pay any deductible.  Still, the whole experience has really soured us on  Enterprise.  Because of all of the delays, we still have not been able to file a claim with our credit card to get a refund for the $500 that we paid for the damage.  Every time we call, Enterprise tells us that they do not  know how much longer it will take to resolve this issue.  We took numerous pictures of the hood, but there seems to be no way to plead our case with Enterprise.  It has been an incredibly frustrating ordeal.","stars":1}

They told us they were not doing outside seating. They said they were no tables in the hallway of mall either. Then they said we would have to wait for a table despite our reservation. Another older lady came in and asked why she couldn't sit outside and was upset. Long story short we took our 87 year old grandmother on oxygen to the restaurant across the hall where they quickly accommodated our situation. If you have outside seating during COVID can we please use it? And if there are not going to be tables please be courteous enough to call us so we can go somewhere else and not make our grandmother walk all around for an open restaurant.

To be honest, I wasn't immensely impressed with either, but that has more to do with me not liking the ingredient combos.  (Tartar sauce on top of the Miss Sake Bomb was a huge turn off.)  The preparation and portion size was perfect though, and the service was nice.  If Fat Salmon were local to me, I would not hesitate to go back and try some other rolls.","stars":4}

Received arrangement last week not  even remotely representative of it's cost, not to mention the brown spots on the leaves and the fact that petals began falling within an hour of delivery. I immediately left  a message relaying my dissatisfaction and had to call again because I received no return call. I asked that the flowers be picked up and that my account be credited for the full amount. The flowers were picked up within the hour and a week later, my account is still not credited.... When I called yet again to speak with the owner, my call was returned by another sales associate who was rude and indignant and hung up on me.... Would obviously never recommend.

{"region":"EAST","text":"All I need to say is: LOBSTER MASHED POTATOES. Go. Eat. Moan. \n\nIt doesn't hurt that this cute & charming restaurant is located in the lush green suburbs (being from CA I call this 'the country') outside of Philadelphia. Earlier in the day I went on a driving tour of the Valley Forge National Park and frolicked through local parks, walking trails, ponds, and farmhouses. This was the backdrop to me being at Parc Bistro so I was already in a good mood.\n\nMy friend and I ordered 4 appetizers to share as our dinner and finished up our experience with 2 desserts:\n\nThe day's special BBQ pork ribs in a smoked pepper sauce was finger-lickin' good, and flavorful but not spicy. The ribs were stacked up Jenga-style, which I thought was really cute. \n\nThe shrimp risotto was creamy with plump shrimp chunks and had a nice oniony flavor from the fried julienned leeks on top. It was served in a small ramekin which is typically too small of a serving for the cost ($13.75) but we savored every delicious bite. It's definitely worth the experience.\n\nThe sauteed spinach was satisfying, not overcooked, and a good (healthy) complement to the other heavier dishes.\n\nLast but not least, the lobster mashed yukon potatoes -- otherwise known as, the reason why we came. As someone who loves seafood and comfort foods, I was in heaven. It had been a while since I've had such creamy, buttery, fluffy mashed potatoes... and the kicker is that you'll find large chunks of lobster inside! Absolute genius. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the butterscotch pudding served in an edible chocolate cup with whipped cream on top and a Tahitian creme brulee that came with an edible spoon. The desserts were definitely good with excellent presentation, but taste-wise not at the same level as our dishes were. (If any of the kitchen staff happen to read this: would it be possible to make the butterscotch a little smoother & creamier, and maybe add some brown sugar and cinammon to the pastry spoon? Just some suggestions.)\n\nService was impeccable and parking was easy since they have their own lot. After dinner, take a walk through the main strip full of antique shops, housewares, and knick-knacks, or have a drink at the outdoor bar across the street. \n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful dining experience and a great place for a romantic dinner or to celebrate a special occasion.","stars":5}

I always had trouble finding free weights to use as well-- it's almost like people steal them. Also, there was always some sort of leaky drop ceiling issue..\n\nThe past month they renovated the locker rooms and alternated male\/female daily. It was a massive inconvenience since there wasn't another bathroom and the closest PSC was too far for me to use as a part of my daily routine. All in all,  I would avoid this place. Even with a locker room renovation,  I don't think it'll ever be worth your $30\/month.","stars":2}

The menu was pretty big and I found myself wanting everything I saw - tomato soup and grilled cheese, French onion soup, BBQ wings, roast beef sandwiches...\n\nI settled on the mac and cheese and it was ridiculously amazing (pic posted). Their sandwiches come with either a salad, fries, or TATER TOTS! They also keep sriracha ketchup on the table. In addition to the mac and cheese, I got a portabella, red pepper, and spinach sandwich. It was good but nothing amazing (except for the bun which was super soft). \n\nQuick tip - they don't carry Coke or Pepsi products, but instead they have sodas made with real sugar. \n\nI'd go back again!

The food is very well done, the crabcake sandwich is served with lettude and tomato on the side as to not make either bread or crabcake soggy. That is thoughtful. The fries are very crunchy and ridiculously delicious. I suspect the ice cream you get here is made in house as several people I dined with noted how incredibly good it is. The jello is also very good. The selection of desserts is quite lovely, and their turnovers burst with filling, in stark contrast to so many other turnovers I have encountered in my eating career.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Abysmal would be a compliment.  \n\nWe ordered online for pickup, when we arrived at the time we were told the food would be ready, it was not. And on top of that they were out of ice cream so no shakes..  It took another 28 minutes to get us 2 burgers, 1 fry, and 1 haystack onion rings.  It seems that the burgers must have been read on time, because by the time we got them cold, i mean room temperature, congealed cheese and all.  The buns at this point were like stale bricks, there was 1 strip of bacon broken in half on our avocado bacon burger, and 1 and i mean only 1 sliver of avocado.  Every aspect of this meal was an atrocity.  The only upside was the apology from the girl at the counter for the delay, along with a 5 dollar off coupon.   Well, considering that I spent 23.50 for cold and poorly prepared food, I feel completely ripped off. Never again will I waste my hard earned money there again.  I'd rather smash myself in the head then go there again. If I could have given them a lower rating I would.","stars":1}
{"region":"EAST","text":"I was not impressed with this bar\/restaurant. I met a friend to watch a big college football game on a Saturday night. The restaurant was not too crowded but we could hardly get our server to attend our table. We spent a lot of time trying to flag her down. There were TVs everywhere playing various sports games (plus). The restaurant serves typical bar food. Nothing notable on the menu. We ordered wings and onion rings. A few wings were undercooked and my onion rings were totally overcooked. Super deep fried. So fried, that the onions were basically disintegrated. To add further to my list of complaints, we ordered a margarita and a rum and coke. I was served my margarita in a large water glass (which basically means all juice) and my friend's rum and coke came in a cocktail glass! WTF? :-\/ Thankfully, our server was apologetic and had the bartender make my drink in a proper cocktail glass and with better tequila :-)  I appreciated the gesture which is why I am awarding 2 stars instead of 1.\n\nOverall, Field House is conveniently located near my house and a great place to watch sports but do not come here expecting quality food or efficient service.","stars":2}

She comes back and doesn't say anything besides \"I said something to him.\"\n\nI've had other run ins with this same issue and started setting appointments but they still manage to mess things up at this place. I guess it's time to find a new barbershop because this place has the worst business model. What is the point in being able to make appointments if you can't stick by them? \n \nMaybe one day this place will hire people who this expert knowledge to know how to read paper and have people seated in the order they walk in, but probably not because it's a very hard thing to do.","stars":1}

NOPE, I was wrong. At the Reds you get into that section and it's all you can eat and drink. Here it's a la cart. Like the Reds I could see the game from the hallway that is airconditioned but that's it. No real seating and the price for a la cart food is not right. The ballpark is pretty and easy to get to. Oh and the Phillies pack up food at a grill in the 6th inning.  Reds at like 8th inning.  Final answer? Go see the park. pay normal to cheap seats because unlike the Reds champion section, they struck out.","stars":3}

I decided to take the trip to the new location for a change, but unfortunately everything I love about the other location they lack here. \nOn a side note-  It definitely wins for the space and d\u00e9cor-- they did a great job. \nWe sat at the bar, and I ordered my favorite Mexican Beer that I LOVE to say they have at the Newark Location, Victoria, but nope not here. \nThen we ask If we could have some of the famous corn nuts that they always make at the Newark Location, nope, we don't do them here. \nNext up, we order the Nachos, because we LOVE the plantains that they use at the Newark Location that makes them different, and like nothing else you can get at other Mexican Restaurants, nope not here. They give you the generic pre-made chips. \nSo, we took another look at the menu, but they didn't have either of our favorites from the other location, so we decided to leave and go somewhere else. \nWe were very disappointed that this place is so different than the other one. \nWe will definitely go back to the first location, but this one doesn't have anything special about it.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I came here for Restaurant Week with my boyfriend and the food, service, and ambiance was perfection. The restaurant itself had an old rustic feel to it with exposed brick on every corner. The service was great and with COVID-19, the servers kept their distances and wore face masks. Tables were all separated as well. \n\nNow to the best part! Without a doubt, you complementary bread for the table. The roasted pepper spread was out of this world! \n1) roasted pepper and aged crostini was a free appetizer. Light and refreshing - absolutely delicious.\n2) truffle buratta was beautiful in presentation. The buratta was delicious and refreshing as well - a perfect end of the summer type of meal. One thing it lacked was the truffle essence. \n2) Pork & smoked panchetta polpette was delicious! The meatballs were juicy and savory. \n3) Gnocchi was just wow. Imagine biting into a pillow and everything melts away. This was probably the best gnocchi I've ever had! The truffle cream too worked very well with this meal. \n3) sole francaise was delicious as well! The seafood (crab meat and shrimp) were super fresh and worked very well with the blanc sauce. The fish was cooked very well and was breaded so lightly and didn't overpower the fish. Just be careful because I encountered a few bones!\n4) lemon tart, mini cannoli, and chocolate torte - all delicious! The lemon tart was refreshing, Chocolate chip cannot was perfect and wasn't too sweet. The chocolate torte was delicious, but was a bit rich and dense.\n\nOverall, definitely worthy of trying! The restaurant did a great job with restaurant week and was very generous with their portions. My boyfriend and I had a few leftovers that we can't wait to pick at again.","stars":5}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Over rated, over priced and you are forced to hear the owner belt out songs at a decibel level just under that of a jack hammer or jet taking off.\nFour of us had reservations for 6:30 PM on a recent Saturday night. Lula was at the door but seating us was below her level so she called over one of the wait staff who was taking a table of four's order. We had to stand and wait while she returned to her primary job while Lula just stood there. We were seated, given menus, water and bread in a short period of time. Our order was taken in a less then timely manner. The soup and salads arrived rapidly and it was down hill from there. After 45 minutes, my wife's dinner came and some 20-25 minutes later mine came. The other people waited and waited and finally there's came some 30 minutes after. In the meantime, Lula was at the mike screeching in a loud voice a number of songs of the past that ended any conversation in the restaurant as well as songs inappropriate for dinner music including Me and Bobbie McGee;  Lula is no Janice Joplin. Our friends are not complainers but I am. I found her after her show and asked what is going on with the kitchen that it is so unorganized. I was given a lecture on you don't know how hard the restaurant business is, my husband is the chef and that they can not afford to hire any additional help. It's not as if they just opened as they have been there at least four years. Lula started making the rounds and when she got to our table, she ignored me but concentrated on my wife and her girl friend and explaining how hard the restaurant business is and that they can not afford to hire a chef. I finally got into the conversation and said I would not be back and she said I'm the only one that has said that; pity she does not see Trip Advisor. As for the food, my wife said her duck was excellent, our friends said there's was ok and as for my broiled crab cakes, they were deep fried, one side was burnt and they were more filler then crab. Lula did offer complimentary dessert which we declined and I asked about reducing the bill. She once again offered dessert.\nThere was also a show across the street at the Pitman theatre and for those that were there well before us, they rushed to make the show.\nAs a point, our waitress said that the reason it took so long for the food is that another wait staff had picked up three of the four  orders and gave them to another table. She had also come to the table with two orders that were not ours; in hind sight, we should have taken those two\nWant a great meal in Pitman for the same price, better service and better food, try Barcelona just down the street.\nSo beware if you go to Sweet Lula's.\nErnest M.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Like probably most, I stopped in to Jet Rock while on a layover in Philly. I was in the mood for a real meal, and this was a convenient location. Doesn't have the greatest reviews, but I thought I'd give them a try. Reviews are sometimes wrong, right? Wrong...they're right. \n\nI decided to sit at a table near the bar instead of at the bar itself. It's football season, so I was still interested in taking a glance or two at the TVs from time to time. Hah. good luck with that one. You better have better than perfect 10\/20 vision. They have a lot of TVs, but they sure are small. They seemed to be something in the order of 15\". And what was up with the signal? The pictures on many screens were fuzzy, as if someone needed to go up and fix the bunny ears. So, not a lot of football watching for me. Eh. Whatevs. I was there for food; not football. \n\nService, however, is part and parcel to food. It's how I get my food, how it's presented, and what affects my mood for when said food arrives. I wasn't a fan. For starters, my waitress was grumpy. I don't know why, but I don't care why. Fake happiness for my sake please. She was also slow. Well, to be completely fair, the \"service\" was slow. The dining area is pretty large, with plenty of seating. My waitress may have been the only server working at the time. There 'might' have been two, but I couldn't say for sure. Either way, things were slow. Definitely don't come here if you're in a hurry, or even have doubts about whether you can squeeze in a meal before your connection. Here...there will be no \"squeezing in\". \n\nThat's service; how about presentation? A little on the ridiculous side if you ask me. And since it's my review, you're technically asking. My food came out on a plastic plate and served with plastic utensils! Really? Really. This isn't a potluck or a picnic. I went to a real restaurant for a grown-up meal. Poor form.\n\nLast, but not least, there's the food. I had a cheese steak (I know, I know. Cliche for Philly, and shouldn't get one at the airport of all places). It wasn't bad at all. Nothing super special or to write home about, but it was a pleasant meal. I liked it. It might actually have even been pretty good! Who knows for sure? May have appreciated it more had I not already been in a sour mood by the time it showed up. Neither here nor there, though. I'm not going back.","stars":2}

{"region":"EAST","text":"The worst!   I will never eat here or any other Applebees!\n\nThe manager should be washing dishes, a position that may suit his personality best instead of a managerial position that allows for him to deal with the customers directly.. He lacks profesionalism and customer service skills. \n\nOn April 26, 2013  my sister and I stopped at the Applebees on Aramingo ave for a meal and a couple drinks to celebrate her bday that was the day before.\n\nThe waitress sat us down and took our drink orders, my sister ordered a glass of wine and a corona, while I ordered a mojito. The waitress informed us  she was only able to bring one drink at a time to a customer...we said fine...my sister asked that she bring the wine first but please do not take too long in bringing the  beer, the waitress said ok.\n\nThe waitress brought over our drinks to our table, the wine for my sister and the mojito for me, she took our food order, we also placed a food order to go. \nA short time later, the waitress returns with the corona for my sister..her  glass of wine still full. I took  a sip of my mojito and did not like it...it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  It actually taste  like a soda or spritzer. The waitress stopped  at our table and asked me how was my drink? I said I dont  like it, a bit too sweet for me. She offered to take it back and bring me something else. I said no thank you , I  will keep it, I did not want to make a big deal out of it. The waitress brings over our appetizer, by the way the portions were small, hardly enough for two people to share. My sister asked to try my drink and so she did, she said she liked it, she offered to take my drink and I could order something else...I agreed. I asked the waitress to bring me a glass of wine.\nWell, this is when the manager from hell comes over to our table.\nThe manager walks over to our table...doesnt even introduce himself...his first sentence to me was \"Oh no, \"THAT\" is not happening here! while pointing to our drinks on the table.  I asked him what was  \"THAT\" that we are doing? He continues to explain the one drink at a time to a customer rule and that my sister had three drinks in front of her. I explained how she ended up with my drink.\nHe refused to bring me the  glass of wine until there were less drinks on the table.\nI could understand if he refused to serve my sister another drink but to refuse ME it just didnt make any sense. He said if I did not understand the rule, he could clear the table. Clearing the table meant, he would call the police and have us removed.\nKeep in mind, not at any time was I rude, loud, obnoxious. We had not previously been drinking...the only drink I had was a water. His attitude was unwarranted.\n I say to him, it is customerary at times for someone to order a shot an a beer, what does he do in that situation? He continues to say oh no, that is not allowed here at Applebees.  He walks away. I am left baffled. The waitress brings  over our order. Again, the side  portions are small except for the steak but it was overcooked and tasteless. My sister feels bad that I do not have  a glass of wine to enjoy with my meal, so she drinks  the mojito fairly fast so we would have one less drink on the table. The waitress comes over takes away the empty glass, my sister asked the waitress to bring me my wine...the waitress said no that the manager will still not allow for her to bring the wine.  Why?? \nWe finish our meal and our food order to go was ready and we obtained the bill.\nWell, here comes the manger from hell again, stopping at our table. \nHe asked me if \"WE\" were ok?  the \"WE\" he was referring to was he and I. \nI say  NO  \"WE are not ok!  He continues to say \"I thought you understood the rule. I said I understand the rule but that doesnt mean I agree with it or I am accepting of the rule. And I do not know how the rule even  apllies to me. I came to Applebees to eat a meal, have a drink and spend some time with my sister...I have been refused a glass of wine for no apparent reason.. All I wanted was a glass of wine with  my meal. Thanks to him, my  evening was ruined and my experience here at Applebbes was terrible! At that time he offers to bring me a glass of wine! I said NO! I am done my meal, our order to go is ready and I have my bill ready to be paid, all I want to do is leave! I do not want to stay here any longer! He walks away. No apologies...nothing!\nI should of walked out from the begining. \nThe worst experience ever!","stars":1}

I love the way the app is setup where you have a choice of every single thing that goes on your pizza, wings, etc. It's very easy to use, they have a pretty reasonable point system to get rewards and free pizzas. After my first order, I received a free pizza. \nWith the contactless delivery, it's very safe and brings me comfort. The delivery time was very fast & I was able to visibly track on the app via GPS when they pizza was prepped and each step of delivery.\nWill definitely be ordering from this location more often!","stars":5}

Well, I was right about the prices but everything we had was delish!  The hostess was all smiles and soo nice, she even let us pick which table we wanted to sit at - the server was also far above average exceeding all of our expectations.  If you're a 'foodie' looking for great presentation of dishes you wouldn't normally find at an average restaurant- this is the place.","stars":4}

Walk up to front desk where 4 people were standing around chatting. One of them kinda offered to help me and told me to go upstairs.\n2. Go upstairs, have someone (not a doctor) give me an high-tech eye exam and take pictures of my eyes.\n3. Sit and wait for doctor for 20 minutes.\n4. See doctor who talks to me and asks questions while looking at his computer (not so much with eye contact with his patient).\n5. Eye exam done fine, but doctor tells me the dude who took pics of my eye has to redo one of them because it wasn't good enough.\n6. Retake pic and told to wait for doc (another 10 minutes) before he comes out and says, \"what are you still doing here?\" Apparently he didn't need to see me after the new pic.\n7. Try to pay before leaving and am standing in front of front desk again with same 4 people standing chatting and no one attempts to help me. At this point I was tempted to just walk out and see if they noticed but one guy finally said, \"are you waiting to check out?\" Yep, you bet I am.\n8. I was told (incorrectly it turns out) that my insurance doesn't cover the visit and that they would happily call Aetna to confirm this but it would take a 20-minute phone call and they just weren't into that.\n9. I pay and then they try to sell me $1,000 frames made out of wood. I tell them I'm going to Warby Parker and they trash them.\n10. Still waiting for my new prescription and the sample contacts doc promised to order. This was almost two weeks ago.\n11. Disappointed and hoping to find a new place to go.","stars":1}

{"region":"EAST","text":"I was super excited to come to this place for brunch after seeing some of the high ratings on Yelp. Though I did enjoy the food here, I wouldn't necessarily peg this place to be a Philly favorite and I probably would not come back again.\n\nI love the menu offerings, and the ambiance and music was so great and authentic. The place had a really cool vibe and it was a fun and lively atmosphere that initially got me really excited about the food.\n\nI tried the Costa Rican breakfast\/brunch dish, and we split the apple croissant cinnamon french toast. \n\nThe apple croissant cinnamon french toast was tasty, but not what I had imagined. The portion size was extremely small, which was a turn off right off the bat. The texture of the dish was good but it felt a little too eggy for my liking. The mixed berries were a good addition along with the honey. The cold cinnamon and apple mixture topping the croissant was cold, and some people at my table didn't like that-- I personally liked it because I'm all about the dynamic contrasts in temperatures with food.\n\nThe Costa Rican dish was tasty, but again was put off by the small portion size for the $13 cost. It came with avocado, a stick of fried cheese, two fried eggs, a haystack of rice, and sweet plantains (maduros). The rice was deliciously flavored with black beans and other vegetables, and I enjoyed eating it with the popped and runny yolk from the fried egg. The sweet plantains were also a delicious treat, but almost a bit too sweet.\n\nOverall, good experience but nothing that I would be dying or craving to go back to.","stars":3}

We paid for extra sauce, as they are very strict on sauces provided (which I understand). However, we were not given any sauces with our order. When we waited to tell him, he was snarky and mentioned we needed to pay for our sauces. I noted, politely, that we did in fact pay and he asked for the receipt, immediately walking away when I turned to get it. When I provided it, he didn't even look. \nAdditionally, he forgot a drink and when I asked for it he told me I only ordered two, which wasn't true. As mentioned, we provided the receipt and he gave it to us, but was very rude. \nThis has happened every time I've been here.

Each table has QR code's for you to access the menu and is separated by plexi glass. We sat down and got a cup of nice hot tea each. \nNow the good stuff, we got tofu skin with spicy crab and rice. Each order came with two pieces and they are quite large. The roll was super refreshing with notes of sesame and cucumber pieces. Their eel sushimi may be one of the best I've had in the city, perfectly sliced, seasoned and cooked. A surprising favorite, the walnut theatre, which featured Japanese oyster tempura, it was crunchy and flavorful. If you like eel avocado, go with their Lancaster road, not their chestnut, which was a little bit of a disappointment for me. The manager, Fandy took great care of us, and we ended the meal with some creamy, red bean ice cream.","stars":5}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Went to this place when they had their \"soft opening\" and I have to say that the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best that I've ever had either. It was really salty. And for the dish that I ordered, I had to send it back twice because it wasn't cooked enough and the communication with all of the servers was WAY off. But of course, it was the first night that they had customers and were working together, so in that sense, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, we were so confused as to who our waitress was, because we had one person greet us, saying that she would be helping us out that night, and then another person came by and said that she was our server. We were confused. Plus, when my dad changed his side order, they messed it up, and then we ended up getting 2 orders of the side dish...obviously they needed to work on their communication. And when I ordered another drink, it took a whole lot longer for it to arrive at the table, compared to the first time I ordered my drink. Everyone was nearly done with their meals. \n\nAnd when we went to leave, we talked with one of the managers and told that person that we thought the food was too salty, blah blah blah, and she didn't want to hear it, just kinda argued with us...not even a thanks for the input, which let me tell you....when we first walked up to the restaurant, they told us to tell them our thoughts...so much for caring about what your future customers are going to think. \n\nBut despite the negative comments, I'll give this place a try a few more times.","stars":3}

You can tell it is a high school\/college crowd for workers.\n\nIt was cool that you get chips and dip on the house to start your meal. The food was okay, I definitely had better Mexican food.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Let me summarize: I think Rustica pizza is fanTASTIC.  I'm not typically a fan of deeper, thick pizzas and am more of a fan of big thin slices (think Lorenzo's style) so my opinion may be biased here.  I had always liked stopping in and grabbing either a plain cheese or mushroom slice if I was in the area and was hungry.  I was not sure if I was alone in my opinion on their pizzas since I'd had others disagree with me.  My feelings on Rustica were validated recently, though, when I convinced my coworkers to choose Rustica when they wanted to order in a few pizzas for lunch. They had never heard of Rustica before and were skeptical but were absolutely raving about it once it arrived.  We ordered a plain cheese, an Old Smokey minus the meat, a meatball pizza, and a pepperoni pizza. People from our department were stopping by to see what smelled so good, coworkers were telling them it's incredibly good, people who sampled what was left were writing down the address and number so they could get it for themselves later, and I even overheard one calling his wife to tell her he \"now knows where to find the best pizza on Earth\".  The meatless Old Smokey went over especially well and was the first to disappear. Everyone who tried a slice said it was a perfect.  Rustica's sauce is not too sweet and actually adds flavor.  The cheese isn't overloaded and greasy.  The crust is thin and crispy.  There is just nothing bad I can say about Rustica pizza at this time and it seems like all of my coworkers now agree.","stars":5}

The server never offered bread (naan), I had to ask him if they are available and when the naan came, it was not cooked properly. \nHe was good at refilling the glasses.\nNever asked if we need anything else or if everything is OK or any other damn thing.\n2. Chholey (Chick-peas)  is a real test. A Chef who cannot make Chholey, can never be a good cook. \n3. Chicken curry was too sweet, I could taste the sugar.\n4. Rice in the Rice-Kheer (dessert) were not fully cooked.\n5. Tandoori chicken was good but it was missing the right amount of salt.\n6. Mattar-Paneer was OK.\n\nAlthough most of the people don't notice these things, but overall all the dishes were missing the real flavor. Maybe I'm from North India and the Chef from some other part and his\/her taste buds are different.\n\nAnd the funny thing is the name of the place is \"Coriander\" and I couldn't taste the coriander herb(Cilantro) in any meals.","stars":1}

{"region":"EAST","text":"I obtained high pain in my left leg, in the thigh and knee area. It wasn't severe enough to go to the hospital but enough to get in the way of moving around easily. I decided to use Lyft to go to Walgreens and come back home but I didn't want to run the risk of having my Lyft driver leave so I called the customer service number for Walgreens. I asked the representative\/employee if it was possible for someone to bring a specific product that I wanted from the floor\/shelf to the cashier counter so that when I get there, I could just pay for it and leave without spending much time in the store. She then connected me to someone in the store. I asked the same question and she then put me on what I thought was a hold. Instead, she  hung up the phone. Thinking that it was a mistake, I requested the Lyft and went to Walgreens. I limped my way in there and found an employee who wasn't doing much of anything and asked if this product was at the cashiers counter and instead of checking the counters, she just said that she didn't know what I was talking about and suggested that I talked to someone in the photo section. THE PHOTO SECTION. The lady in the photo section was already helping someone else didn't know what I was talking about so she called for someone to assist me. I stood there for at least five minutes. I became nervous of my Lyft driving possibly leaving me soon so I decided to limp my way around the store to find a knee brace. I found it and told the lady in the photo section to not call for someone else for the third time (she called for assistance a second time while I was looking for a brace) because I already found one. Luckily, the employee that I spoke to after entering the store rung up a previous customer and so checkout wasn't long. Overall, I would have rather someone tell me that I couldn't have someone bring a product from the floor to the cashier counter over the phone or the employee that I originally spoke to take a FEW minutes to check the counters than to not have no assistance at all. BAD customer service.","stars":2}

{"region":"EAST","text":"This new Tunisian-based BYO is a complete makeover of the Thai operation formerly here. The new decor is awash in soft, light blue (what else?) executed with exceptional taste. The overall effect is delightfully romantic, especially for Doylestown, which can use something \"date night\" like this even though the mellow vibe was diminished by a bright sconce light over our table.\n\nThe owners are obviously anxious to please, and could hardly do more to make folks feel welcome. We were warmly greeted, well taken care of throughout, and even given a complimentary after-dinner degustation.\n\nOur appetizers -- octopus and a meatball special -- were absolutely spectacular, fully worthy of a great restaurant. The latter was spicy in the best sense, with heat used to enhance flavor using a delectable mix of herbs and spices from the owner's mother in Tunisia.\n\nWere the meal to end there, Blu would qualify for a major detour and a solid five stars. Alas, the warhorse mains -- lamb couscous and moussaka -- were ordinare, albeit using superior quality lamb and other ingredients. Couscous was too dry and lacking in flavor complexity, while moussaka came off as little more than pleasant comfort food. If you want worthy moussaka hereabouts, try someplace like Philly's Estia.\n\nThe dessert of superior baklava and dates fared much better except for tiny portion size. If you're more than a nibbler, you're better off walking down the block to excellent Nina's or even Nonno's.\n\nThe owner has had long experience as a chef, and given the investment he's made appears to be playing it safe and predictable with menu offerings. Yet, he obviously has talent worthy of much greater things, so in time the main courses may expand to approach the quality and creativity of the apps we enjoyed. In the meantime, best bet is probably to steer clear of predictable menu choices and spring instead for the specials.\n\nWorth mentioning is how clean this place is, and not only to the eye. We noticed that when a table was cleared off where a family with children had been, the floor area around that table was also wiped down.\n\nWe got out for under $45\/person, plus tip and wine.","stars":4}

The customer service I have received in these past years have been impeccable to the point where the reps bent over backwards to find out if there were any specials or coupons that could ease the service expense. Even when there was nothing they could do to help me, I felt as if they gave it all of their effort. I applaud them. They truly made me feel like a special customer and hence they received my exclusive business. On Sept 16, I once again went for a service call and was met with a different customer service rep. I felt rushed and when I went to pay for the service, I asked if there was any specials or coupons they could help me with. The rep said, \"we don't do that anymore. If you want to find specials or coupons you can go online yourself and see if there is anything available.\" Well I was shocked to say the least and told them politely how I felt. When the rep texted me and asked how my experience was. I once again told her how I felt. She told me she would pass my comments on to the GM. Well the GM called me back the next day and was anything but what I was expecting. His solution was that I should call ahead in the future and stick with the reps that had been so amazing previously. He did apologize if I did not get the service I deserved. And he did tell me that all of the reps were trained the same way. But at the end his solution was to reach out to the previous reps that I liked. My expectation was for the Mgr to ask me how he could make this better? What could he do to retain me as a customer? What could he do to assure me a better experience in the future. I got none of that. Actually the way I felt was that they could care less if I remained a customer. In today's environment, one would think that every business would bend over backwards to retain each and every customer. Losing even one customer should be an epic problem.","stars":1}

We ate here the Friday after Thanksgiving, following a movie in nearby Oaks. \n\nFirst of all, it's inexpensive. They pay their servers a \"living wage\" which means that you are not supposed to tip them. The beer and wine prices are very reasonable. I ordered a $6 glass of shiraz. The bar was out of shiraz, so our waitress brought back a small tasting glass of a different red wine. It was a fun way to recommend a different wine. The meals themselves ranged from $8 burgers to $16 entrees.\n\nSecondly, it's kind of fun to peek out at a grocery store while you eat. I was focused on chatting with my friends, but if I was eating alone, I would have loved having the opportunity to plan out my grocery shopping trip while I ate my meal. \n\nThirdly, the food is surprisingly good for a grocery store. We started with a few fried appetizers. The french fries were cooked with tarragon, served with a spicy ketchup and delicious. The other two appetizers, fried mozzarella and zucchini strings, were just okay. I recently changed to a vegetarian diet, and I ordered a veggie burger for my meal. It was homemade at the store with quinoa and millet, topped with a spicy sauce reminiscent of Indian fare, and sitting on top of a toasted whole wheat bun. It was delicious. The burgers and entrees are served with either the side salad of the day or the vegetable of the day.

When I go out to a restaurant in the city, I expect something of a dress code, unless I know I'm going to a dive bar or hipster foodie place.  But to go to the top of the 2 Liberty building, where this has been described as one of the most romantic views of the city, you don't expect to see t-shirts, baggy jeans and running\/basketball shoes.  I thought maybe there was a special party or group there taking over the place for the night, but the staff assured me it was just a normal Saturday night.  We were having dinner with out of town friends, who wanted a fine dining experience in the \"big city\" (they're from Scranton\"), and had heard from one of their friends about the view here.  I was a little uncomfortable as the clientele had a certain attitude and there were more than a few foursome+ of young males sitting around the bar just staring at the diners.  My guests were visibly uncomfortable, she kept her purse on her lap for most of dinner.  These are all trivial and little things by themselves, but add up to make a really bad dining experience.\n\nSo, enough about the ambiance, and onto the food.  Well, can't really say, after a really uncomfortable 15 minutes at the bar, we felt so out of place with the environment, that we rushed through the meal to leave as soon as we could.  From previous dining experiences here (admittedly, the last time I ate here was over 3 years ago), I remember an awesome mac & cheese dish, a better than average steak, and a few appetizers worth coming back for.

We scheduled for them to come and physically inspect boiler, that appointment was rescheduled. Then the owner calls me at the time of the 2nd appointment to tell me they can't do anything since THEIR warranty was over. Plus I was told that when I make the claim, the manufacture will ask for me to go through the contractor, but that I insist that the manufacture deals with me only and not them. On top of that, I was told that the only way they would help me with my claim was if I gave them the contract to install new boiler. WOW!!!!! I had them out in 2020 as the boiler was not working and the guy who inspected my boiler stated that the insides of my boiler looked like I had a flood, but the outside showed no evidence of a flood. He wasn't sure what the cause was, but told me that he could change the parts inside. What a joke. I left it alone as the boiler started working.  I had another contractor come in to change my water tank and I asked them to take a look, told them the situation, that I was told the insides could be changed. He looked puzzled and said no way you can change these insides, why would Ingrams tell you that? When the new contractor changed my water heater, he also cleaned out my boiler \/ radiator lines. Me not fully understanding that, I contracted Ingrams to come and do this for me. I was charge a pretty penny for Ingrams to come out to do this work.

Decor is unremarkable but appealing but i didnt visit here for decorating ideas, it was the food.  Newly opened with three glowing reviews already, I was stoked to trynit.  Started with a complimentary serving of Papadum accompanied by red pickled onions, green curry, and a tamarind sauce.   All very good, I. especially enjoyed the green curry and pickled onions.    Up next the appetizer that really peaked by interest, Paneer 65.    Firm large cheese curds fried and served in a very spicy red sauce.   The texture of the curds reminiscent of firm tofu with a nice bite feel.   The sauce was aromatic and zesty with a heat that creeps up you slowly, but once it has established itself you won't soon forget it.    Last but not least was a kicking goat vindaloo.   Chunks of tender goat and white potatoes in a piquant red chili curry with the slightest hint of vinegar.   Served with basmati rice but I opted for some chili nanaan also and both paired well.   The nanaan was perfect for dredging up the extra sauce and causing a spice induced brow sweat of the good kind.

The Brussel sprouts could use a little more of a sweet factor to cut the acidic taste in the sauce and the shrimp tacos needed som color and more acid so I added the pico de Gallo from tbt chips and dip to my plate and it did wonders!

Sports on in the bar TV area and we were led upstairs to the more calm dining area.   Excellent sangria and wine selection, however the food was a little inconsistent.   \n\nAppetizer-- scallop gigantic and surrounded w great flavor but badly undercooked  and had to be sent back for more heat\n\nThe tuna appetizer was ok-- nothing terribly special\n\nOrdered the Brussels sprout w bacon and skirt steak ...came w no bacon and then the waiter showed up without prompting w a second order that was just right and loaded w bacon.   But who wants to eat two hole plates of Brussels sprouts \n\nBeyond that, the meal was shaky.  Ordered skirt steak medium, it came out very rare.   It's impossible for a chef to not know the difference , so when we sent it back, it came back just as red.\n\nBest thing about the meal....my dog loved the skirt steak and we had coffee and a Canoli down the street.  \n\nService was excellent so I'm going w 3.00 star rating to compensate for poor food and expensive prices --the server made it passable","stars":3}
{"region":"EAST","text":"I dined at the Roxborough Seafood House on Saturday, April 13, 2019. \n\nI ordered Mussels as an appetizer and an 18 oz Lobster tail as my entree. The Lobster tail came with roasted red potatoes and broccoli. While eating the Mussels my date and I noticed that they were very salty, he only ate 2.  As I continued to eat them I started to get a little nauseous but I passed it off. They also were very dark and dry. I finished them for our food took so very long to come and I was hungry. \n\nWhen my food finally arrived the lobster looked so good and it became increasingly difficult to eat lobster with a plastic fork. I asked the owners daughter\/relative for a silver\/stainless steel fork at which she sent my server over to advise me that they didn't have any in the establishment. I've never eaten Lobster with a plastic fork neither will I ever again. It's very difficult. The lobster was a little tough to hold and cut with a plastic fork. I also had to request a knife for my meal as one was not bought out to me. I guess I was supposed to pick up the tail and bite it. While attempting to eat the roasted potatoes I couldn't get pass a strange sour taste on the potatoes. I mentioned it to my server and she took them back and had the chef to simply boil them with butter. Those were better. I don't know what that sour, bitter, almost bad taste of a sauce was. \n\nAnyway, once I left the facility before we could get home I had to go to the bathroom real bad. I went 5 times with diarrhea within 20 minutes. That's not it. This went on for 24 hours. Sick as a dog. Diarrhea, chills, pains in my stomach, hot flashes, gas, etc. I was so sick and today, Wednesday I'm still not myself, although the diarrhea has stopped. I told my partner that I don't ever want to eat there again. I'm scared. It was bad folks, real bad. I don't know if it was the Mussels or the rotten sauce on the potatoes but I'm leaning towards the seafood because it was bad. No one should go out to eat dinner and walk out sick. No one. So I just had to write this review because I should not have had to experience this and that's why I'm writing this review. I've eaten here once before with a favorable review. \n\n\nThis time this place did not deserve even one star. I felt like I was going to die.\n\nI'd like an apology. I tried to take away the one star but I can't. Although I know that I'll never get an apology, people Beware...","stars":1}

I was unimpressed with the cheese platter, and the server did not explain what we had before us at all. \nI have to admit that the things they do right they do VERY right. My bf had a grilled ham and cheese, which he said was good but standard, but the fries were perfect. I mean, perfect. Made the meal. They were really not even very greasy. \nMy salad with goat cheese and figs was good, fresh, but drenched in dressing. I would definitely order dressing on the side next time. Very good salad, tho. And I eat a lot of salads, I'm not always easy to please. \nThe perfect creme brulee was a must, being at a french restaurant on the street on a lovely breezy May evening. As was the white wine, which was a crisp and light Pinot Grigio, very refreshing. BF had some beer, nothing memorable. I also tried a drink which had wine and some strong, strong peach liquor. Quite nice, but two could be a problem! \nIf you don't mind paying more than you need to for food that is not particularly inspired, you might find the ambiance, the fries, and the creme brulee worth it.","stars":3}

Without even talking about the food, the Green Room has a very grand, historic feel to it. Take a look around and soak in the atmosphere.

Well, maybe a very nice hoodie.\n\nThe food hasn't disappointed me yet. I do have to warn you though: most of the stuff is pretty rich and buttery, so don't plan on being too productive for the next couple of hours.

Surely a party arriving at 6 pm has plenty if time to make a 7:30 pm curtain across the street!  We immediately advised our sever that we needed to leave by 7:15 pm or shortly later. \n\nThe three small dish starters we ordered arrived quickly.  So we began the evening sensing that they were too hurried in their service.  That said, the beef tartare and chicken livers starters were excellent and we recommend them.  The carrot starter has gotten a lot of praise from other reviewers, but we thought it was at best okay.\n\nWe ordered the chicken entree but questioned the $31 price tag.  Excellent chicken dishes at some our favorite places like Fond, Nord, and Ulivo are normally prices in the much lower zone of $15 to $25.  The waitress explained it was a large portion that could be shared so we gave it a shot.\n\nAt 10 to 7 we were waiting patiently and I reminded the server we needed to leave in about 30 minutes.  Regrettably the chicken arrived but very late, at around 7:10 pm.  The manager expressed his deep regrets and agreed to take the charge off our bill.  If he is reading this, when inevitably this occurs again, I suggest you go further than the obvious.  How about an offer to waive the bar charge for our two drinks, or a free entree if we come back? It would have been a nice gesture and may have given us cause to consider trying you place a second time.\n\nJim Macdonald","stars":1}

Most of the companies require a 1-3 year contract that is irrevocable if the person dies. We went with this company because of their month to month commitment. Also, these companies continually call their elderly clients to sell them more stuff. \n\nI signed up for this service and used my credit card for the charges under my name to protect my parents. My parents are not authorized to purchase additional services with my card. I would highly suggest doing this if you use this company! \n\nWhen i signed up and had the customer service rep. put in my parents file; \"DO NOT MAKE SALES CALL, PATIENT HAS DEMENTIA\". In spite of many promises (before we signed up) that they would not make any unsolicited calls to my parents they have multiple times. They actually convinced my dad to order something and couldn't tell me what it was. When I called Medical Alert to tell them to reverse the charges as they were unauthorized by me, you first hear a recording that tells you that they never make unsolicited call and take great pains to protect their clients and If you received an unsolicited call it was from a company pretending they were medical alert.........long story short....that voicemail was a lie. Medical Alert did make the unsolicited call to my dad and he had ordered another service without understanding what it was. I called back 3 times and finally talked to a supervisor who told me that the recording I heard meant they don't make \"random\" calls.....SO THEY REDEFINE WHAT THE WORD UNSOLICITED MEANS SO THEY CAN PREY OFF THEIR ELDERLY CLIENTS\".

It was really a one of a kind experience for South Jersey and exceeded my expectations completely. The food here is like other Japanese restaurants you may have been to - but way better, and carefully crafted. \n\nIt seems silly to review a restaurant that has nearly 500 glowing reviews but I'll try my best.\n\nThe atmosphere is definitely different than anywhere I've ever been. It's dim, cozy, low ceilings and lots of wood decor. There are few tables and in general it's pretty narrow. For me, personally - I love it. I felt relaxed and at ease, even a little romantic. \n\nThe menu is only two pages. It seems like the chef only wants to serve their best work. I appreciate it, honestly. \n\nThe prices are higher than you will find at most other sushi restaurants in the area - but you get what you pay for. The dark red tuna really speaks for itself - it's fresh as fresh can be. My friend and I ordered fish over rice - he ordered the raw fish and I ordered the eel over rice, and we shared our food. The rice in each dish was seasoned completely differently to compliment the eel vs the raw fish. We ordered our entrees as dinners to get the included soup, salad, and ice cream. Everything was amazing. I love sushi and I'm not a snob but I really felt like the food at Sagami was special and of better quality than other restaurants I've eaten at. \n\nI've read a lot of reviews complaining about slow service so I want to address that - our food was served VERY quickly, but we did not order sushi rolls, so that may have had something to do with it. There are so many people on staff in this restaurant - really I've never seen so many attentive servers.

My flight was $9 for 4-5oz beers which included: IGB grapefruit pale ale, heritage surf IPA, lucy, and knotty IPA. My least favorite was the knotty and my favorite was definitely the heritage surf IPA. The heritage had a fruity, citrusy taste that i loved. The vibe of this place is pretty laid back, there's TVs only at the bar from what i can tell. I would have enjoyed to tour the brewery but i missed the 4pm tour because i was eating. The tours cost $10 and you must wear closed toed shoes. I would definitely come back to Yards next time I'm in philly.","stars":4}

{"region":"EAST","text":"So I had a toothache and like a total loon, I don't have dental insurance. My sister decides to see what \"Doctor\" Google can recommend and she finds me this place.  It serves a little bit as an urgent care place for dental needs but you can also make an appointment and it does accept insurance.  If you're paying out of pocket, it's $150 for the X-rays\/exam then the cost of any additional intervention.  That's not cheap but thankfully, Yelp to the rescue!  There's a deal on Yelp for $75 towards $100.  You still have to pay the remaining balance but ultimately you save yourself $25 bucks, which is nice.  This place also sees patients 7 days a week so if you have a busy schedule, this is a good place for you too.\n\nThis place is located within a PMC Property Group apartment building, so you have to ring a bell at the entrance to be let in, then you simply take the elevator up to the 9th floor.  As other Yelpers mentioned, the waiting road looks like it's been renovated.  It has a large TV and many leather\/pleather-ish seats but does fill up easily so you easily wind up sitting elbow-to-elbow with a stranger.  The water cooler wasn't working when I was there.  The exam rooms look a little more dated but one of the dental assistants told me they're moving to a new location soon.  All the forms are paperless and you fill them out on an Ipad.\n\nI was seen by Dr. Adibe while I was there.  He was very pleasant and professional.  I'm hoping to get dental insurance and not have to pay as much for a dental visit next time but in a pinch, this was a great option and I felt like my dental needs were adequately addressed.","stars":4}

I was waiting to pick up an order I placed it took them five minutes to even acknowledge I was there with three people behind the bar. Two of which looked right at me and turn their heads. Finally when the one bartender came up she gave me the bill and said it'll be a little bit before it gets there even though the food was sitting not even a foot away from where I was  standing at the bar. I had my money all ready to pay for the food and 10 minutes went by and she never even once came over. I had the bill and money in my hand staring right at her and she blatantly turned her head and walk to help someone else who had just walked up to the bar to order a beer. That is the attitude that gets you no tip. Especially when she didn't not even prepare the food and I would have tipped her 20% on my bill.

For $14 you're not getting filet mignon.

For $14 a head you can find a poke station with salmon options or the Hibachi grill with fresh chicken breast filets. They even have shrimp options here so fresh that you have to crack the head off the shrimp to get to the meat.\n\nFor dessert United offers soft serve ice cream and hot fudge. They also offer the standard bannana puddings and jello you'll find elsewhere. My one complaint is that the soup is essentially at the same station as the dessert, if you're confused and find things slightly disorganized, just ask for help.\n\nThere's also a fresh salad bar with various lettuce choices.\n\nStick with fresh items or with seafood and you'll be very pleased.

Another reason why I'm no longer thrilled with this diner, is because that same night I was last there, more than 2 of the dishes that was ordered, the food wasn't cooked throughly, but we didn't notice any differnece in taste until later. One of the dishes we ordered gave our friend food poisoning so we decided to call the diner when we got home to see if we could get our money back or at least talk to a manager about what had happened. When we called, the night manager told us that the owner was not in at the time and told us to call back or come in the next day. So, we went back the next day to speak to the owner, well that was probably just as disappointing as our visit. When we went back to the diner to speak to the owner, they didn't even hear us out, it was as if they didn't want to deal with us because we had a dissapointing experience. The owner claimed that our dispute was invalid, because no one else that was at the diner that night complained about getting food poising.  After we explained what had happened and asked for a refund, they only offered to give us a $20 gift card, instead of giving our money back.","stars":1}

He was incredibly friendly and excited. And he gave real-talk about the food. He actually steered us away a bit from the Caesar salad (known as a popular menu item) and steered us towards the grilled Octopus, which was cooked perfectly with a sear sauces and beans. He came and checked in on us and gave his thoughts on some of the foods we were eating and he also gave us the option to order a main entree and a half pasta.\n\n3. Finally the food - octopus, which I've described before: wonderful. Then the bread that was given out before the main entrees - I had a focacia with the olive oil, garlic, and tomato-based dip that came with it; it was super well-done with the perfect level of hardness on the bread. Finally, I got the Porcini Campanelle; which was perfect.

{"region":"EAST","text":"My experience at the Bar by Bluebird Distillery in The Bourse was great! My friend thought of the idea to stop here for a drink prior to dinner and I was all for it. I hadn't been to The Bourse since the Yelper Party in January so it was nice to return!\n\nFor our first round of drinks, I got the flora airliner - a gin cocktail that comes with maraschino, lavender, cr\u00e8me yvette and lemon. To be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of it and became even less of a fan after trying a sip of the fantastic botanical gardens lemonade that my friend got. This was listed as a non-alcoholic refreshment but my friend asked to add gin to it. I'm not usually too fond of lemonade with alcohol but for some reason I really liked this cocktail! Just as the menu said, it was very refreshing. For our second round of drinks, I was tempted to get that but decided to try something else on the menu and got the natural remedy. So happy that I decided on that because I really loved it! This is also a gin cocktail that comes with green chartreuse, coconut, lime, cinnamon and vanilla. It was sweet but had a nice tart taste. I was a little skeptical about the vanilla, but I didn't taste it at all (thumbs up to that). The natural remedy ended up being the number one cocktail of the night with the lemonade being a very close second. \n\nThe bartender was friendly and made our drinks very well, but service was kind of slow. We waited quite awhile to order a second round of drinks and then to get our check. She was by herself and attending to a full bar on a Saturday night so my guess is that is what made service slower than usual. I feel like a second bartender would have helped to keep things moving. \n\nAll in all, I'd be happy to pop in here for a drink again before dinner.

My go-to is by far the ACME, not Shop-Rite, and here's why.\n\nWhile the sale prices are usually great, they are also equally great at ACME, so that's not a win for either location.  Both stores are city stores, without the wide expansive aisles found in the suburbs.  Either store when busy will be crowded, but Shop-Rite is probably the most cluttered of the two.  ACME definitely wins on parking, but I can walk to that location.\n\nBoth stores have a deli and Shop-Rite generally has a bigger and more reliable (in-stock) selection vs. ACME.  For the available choice of fresh fruits and vegetables, the edge goes to Shop-Rite.  However, for freshness and more LOCAL produce, ACME wins in my book.  Both stores have lots of bakery options.  However, only ACME has a salad bar, while small, it's only $5.99 \/ pound, but limited in options.  I must say the Hot Whole Chickens from Shop-Rite are way better than those at ACME, and cheaper too.  And lastly, sale item availability? The edge goes to ACME, as more often than not the sale items at Shop-Rite are out of stock, or the varieties are down to the unpopular choice.\n\nGenerally a pretty even match.  So the major difference?\n\nCustomer Service!\n\nACME staff is WAY friendlier - it's feel like you are truly in the neighborhood store.  At Shop-Rite, only the Deli compares for service. But forget if you need assistance with the automated check-out or heaven forbid, a price check at Shop-Rite, it's as if you are asking a favor of the staff to help you.  Some folks are really nice, but it's so inconsistent and the last few visits resulted in leaving with that negative impression.

It doesn't matter whether its takeout or dine in, the quality and service is always top notch! 50% off sushi EVERYDAY dine in or takeout?! I never want to leave the area because no sushi place is as affordable and delicious as this one! Whoever thinks 50% sushi is shady needs to look into more sushi places in Bensalem and Feasterville Trevose area because they ALL have 50% sushi.\n\nService-\nIt doesn't matter if its the weekend or weekday the service is always quick, friendly, helpful, professional, and attentive regardless of who is serving me. I've never had any mistakes with my order or any miscommunication. Sometimes they're a little slow with filling up my water, but they will immediately refill your water when you ask. This place is also BYOB, so they provide glasses and open up your wine bottle when you ask. \n\nSushi-\nI've only had the sushi here, so I can't talk about anything else, but I've NEVER had any food poisoning issues due to the food. The sushi has always tasted fresh, they don't skimp on the fish at all like some places do, and the rice is cooked to perfection! Consistent quality that has never done me wrong. I've tried sushi all over Center City that cost anywhere from $6-$12 and NOTHING can beat Osaki's quality and QUANTITY of fish they put inside their maki rolls. I don't think I'll ever stop raving about the amount of sushi they pack into their maki rolls, especially at the price of $2-3 per roll.\n\nParking-\nBe aware that their parking lot is small, so you might have to park in a residential neighborhood. It gets fairly crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, so finding a spot will be hard!\n\nOverall, this is honestly the best sushi you can get in the Philly area, especially at this price. I will continue to go here until I move away and even then I'll still come back to satisfy my sushi craving.","stars":5}

However,  one of the starters was bread and butter for $5!  Seriously?  I've never been charged for bread and butter in my life.  That is giving your customer a bad impression from the beginning.  The service was poor, the waitress didn't know basic server etiquette, such as having women order first and served first, promised items and didn't deliver, etc.  We asked for a wine bucket and they were all being used!  Buy some more wine buckets.  The wait staff needs to be trained much better.  I don't think this place will make it a year, which is a shame.","stars":2}

I can tell you this is a large and messy sandwich which is probably why it was also tasty.  It's not really that hot as its name would suggest and indeed I did not care for the ghost peppers and their texture & flavor that much.  But I liked everything else.

Thankfully, we decided to try it out for ourselves and it was FANTASTIC!!\n\nWe ordered 3 appetizers, a salad, two pasta courses and shared an entree.  We also had 2 desserts!  Each thing we ordered was better than the last.  The calamari was so fresh and perfectly breaded\/fried (this is a must-have). The pear salad was unbelievable...the Gorgonzola cheese was such a nice contrasting flavor with the pear.  The pastas were incredibly fresh and obviously handmade.  Don't leave without trying the desserts. We had homemade ricotta cheesecake and a seasonal pumpkin bread pudding.  It was ridiculously awesome!\n\nThe only thing about the restaurant that could be seen as a negative is that the building is a renovated house, so the rooms upstairs are small and compartmentalized.  We ate on the porch, which was great because it was a gorgeous night.  If you go, request the downstairs. In my opinion it is a nicer atmosphere than the rooms upstairs.  \n\nSo, if you like delicious food served by friendly staff and owners who obviously care about their customers, then you have to try this restaurant.  Ignore the \"haters\" on this site...they obviously don't have a clue.","stars":5}

The food is good, but they lose some points for the confused interior.    \n\nWe split a spring roll app, and each had the gnocchi and the eggplant-ball sandwich.  Everything was tasty.  We were satisfied, not blown away, but not disappointed.  Not over frilled and thrilled; basic \"comfort\" food, but nothing like mom's kitchen.  I would like to come back at some point and try some of the other items on the menu, everything looked pretty tasty.  I only tried one mixed drink, and I wasn't particularly impressed - not here nor there.  The beer selection is okay.\n\nThe interior is nice, except for the radioactive glowing jukebox that casts a horrible neon blue light everywhere.  And the TV screens.. sorry fellas just get rid of them!  It just sends a confusing message as to what type of place you are.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Nevermind Christopher K. and his shitty review. You might wanna be a little more descriptive on your \"bad\" experience, buddy.\n\nAnyways, let me start off by saying I grew up in Millstone Township and lived in the suburbs pretty much my whole life. I work in Trenton and I don't really care for that area or most Trenton people. I'm not a fan of hole in the wall bars, but this place isn't bad at all. The bar itself is pretty clean. The only thing that may be considered \"dirty\" is the bathroom. But that's just hard to keep up with at most bars because people get sloppy when they're drunk. Other than that, the pool table area could maybe us a little bit of a renovation. Same with the floors throughout the place. But I don't care about that! This is a hole in the wall bar with a purpose. And that purpose is to serve good, low priced drinks and food. Which they do perfectly. Best of all, the food portions are huge! The crowd is \"unique\" at times, but everybody keeps to themselves and there's never really more than 10 people in there. Unless there's a pool tournament or the jukebox is playing, this place is usually somewhat quiet. Speaking of the jukebox, they have a really good sound system. The owner is super cool and if you get the talking with him about something interesting, he might even buy you a drink.","stars":3}

The moment one person finished their meal, someone was over to take the plate and drop the next course off.

So, it was hard to savor and enjoy the experience as we were rushed throughout...\n\nThe food was good not great, nothing really sticks out.

{"region":"EAST","text":"This place is an absolute dream. \n\nComing from out of state, I was super excited to visit a less tourist-y part of Philly especially since we don't really have any authentic Italian marketplaces in South Florida. Naturally,  to  celebrate this excitement, I spent an absurd amount of money on cured meats and gourmet cheeses. \n\n My friend recommended we check out Di Bruno's  for cheese. It was a very bustling little shop even at 11am on a Friday. We had a faint idea of what we wanted (some Parma) but we're open to some help. There was a lovely employee named Rico who took full advantage of our indecisiveness, and hooked us up with so many delicious samples. The first one he let us try was the Black Betty cheese which was some type of gouda make with goat's milk. It was probably the best cheese I've ever tasted, though I never would have thought to try it if it wasn't for Rico's help. The rest of the staff was friendly and efficient as well. The customers were equally as friendly and enthusiastic about cheese. Needless, to say it was a true Philly bonding experience. \n\nOther highlights of the market: Claudio's had a great selection of meats, cheeses, pastas, and  olive oil. We bought some delicious hot sopressata and prosciutto for a really decent price. Their olive bar is also very impressive. Again, the staff was super friendly and helpful, which is important because sometimes these types of shops can be intimidating if you don't know exactly what you want to buy. \n\nSarcone's bakery has some of the best bread I've ever tasted. They also sold pizza that looked amazing, thick crust and lots of sauce, but I didn't get to try it. \n\nWe also drank really good iced coffee with coffee cubes from Anthony's Italian Coffee House. Would have loved to try some of their chocolates. \n\nBut most of all I loved the atmosphere of this marketplace. Every little shop I wandered into was unique, authentic, and warm, which is exactly how Italian markets should feel. I definitely want to come back here for a festival or just for some more delicious cheese.","stars":5}

Originally I was going to order through UberEats from the University City location, but I figured since I already work downtown that I'd give their Center City location a try. I immediately saw that the wings looked extra crispy, so I decided I'd give them a try. \n\nThey price them by the pound (about $8\/lb), so mine came out to a little over $5 for 5 wings, which I didn't think was that bad for Center City eating. I got the fries for $2.99 and I thought they were substantial for the price. Not to mention they were the crispiest hand-cut fries I've tasted. These kind of fries can either be too chewy or taste burnt, but these particular ones were just right. The wings were great and stayed crispy when I had my leftovers later.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot. Their food is absolutely incredible. I went there for the first time on April 26th this year and have been back every week since, usually with guests who find themselves equally as impressed. I've tried just about everything on the menu, with the exception of the chicken, but that is mainly because I am hopelessly addicted to the brisket. The brisket is absolutely the best I have ever had. They thin slice it and soak it in some kind of stock (not sure if chicken, beef or veggie) to keep it moist. It doesn't make you feel like you have to struggle to swallow it from lack of moisture like many bbq places' brisket does. The pulled pork is great, and don't even get me started on their ribs. The one unique thing they have that you will not be able to find elsewhere in the surrounding areas is pig wings. They are cut from the leg of the pig and are eaten like a rib. These are absolutely fantastic. The meat just falls right off the bone. It might take a little bit of courage being we don't normally eat this part of the pig up here, but trust me, when you get that first taste, you will be blown away. \n\nNow, I will say there are three things I would change about this place. First, more seating. They only have two little tables and a bench to sit at, which makes for a lot of people eating in their cars or taking the food home. Some people even bring their own chairs from home. Second, more hours! They are only open from 10am to 4pm on Saturdays. Having to go a whole week to fulfill my constant craving for this food is tough! Heck, I don't know what I am going to do all winter without them. Last, I'd like to see maybe a weekly special. For instance, maybe a twist on something they already make... like taking their already amazing mac n cheese and adding bacon to it. I think that would put it absolutely over the top. \n\nAll in all, this is the best bbq that you are going to find north of the mason-dixon line and maybe even a couple hundred miles south. I would honestly drive a couple of hours if I had to in order to get this food. Oh, and while you are there, don't forget to stop in the store as well.

She's a nice lady, but she also isn't the most reliable when it comes to waitressing or taking orders.\n2) Since local DirectTV stopped carrying Chinese channels this place has just defaulted to FOX on their TV, which plays DMZ during supper time. Every time I go there for dinner I can feel my brain cells slowly dying. (On that note: they do have bottled beer.)\n\nOne final note: They have mostly very large tables and only a few tables for four. If you go during peak times with a small party be prepared to share a table.","stars":3}

{"region":"EAST","text":"I made my car rental through Hotwire when booking my flight to Trenton Airport.  My reservation stated we would be picked up by Enterprise since it was offsite.  After waiting 15 minutes and watching 2 other car rental vans picking up their customers, we went inside the airport to find out if Enterprise had a different pickup spot.  To our surprise there was an Enterprise Rental inside Trenton Airport.  She said Fairless Hills Enterprise doesn't pickup at Airport. I was offered a rental at that location for 4 times what I paid on line.  I called Fairless  Hills, Ryan said that Hotwire did not provide my phone number on reservation so he could not  contact me. He said that I could take Uber to his location and he would reimburse me.  It was so nice after the stress of the mix up to be offered a solution to the problem that wasn't going to cost extra.  We were greeted by Ryan when we entered. He immediately apologized for the mix up and inconvenience.  We were quickly given our vehicle  and on our way.  Ryan was very understanding and extremely professional.  I received reimbursement for Uber on my bill, just as he said. Ryan also called me after our trip  to ensure that we had no issue with the vehicle. The Jeep was clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this location to rent your vehicle.","stars":5}

So I made the most of it and truth be told, actually ended up having a super-fun night. I think this had everything to do with the fact that I was dancing and hanging out with my buddies, though. Also, the music at first was not that danceable but eventually it got a lot better.\n\nThere's nothing about this club that I would pinpoint and say I didn't like, but I just didn't think that it was anything more special than other clubs that have great dance parties with live djs and do not charge a cover.","stars":2}

{"region":"EAST","text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. First off I will say I have never taken the time to write a review on anything, however if this review helps at least one person who is on the fence about choosing this salon that will be fine.  I made my first appointment with this salon for a balayage appointment (I have had this process done many times at another salon) When greeted I sat down in the chair and the stylist asked if I wanted a single or double process??? Not a term normally used for balayage as it is freeform paint style. I showed the girl several picture of what I wanted. Not only did she make me uncomfortable with her lack of conversation, she basically started to highlight my hair as oppose to painting in a few spots. I had explained how long it took my hair to get healthy and I did not want bleach on my head ( which she smirked with a total attitude \"we don't use bleach) well it was burning my head there was so much. She then proceeded to leave it on my hair for 45min YES 45 I kept track. When my hair was finally washed out I could see that it way about 4 shades lighter then my original NOT WHAT I WANTED and the ends were completely white. I also had dark spot left at my root.  I figured maybe it was lighting and went home as its always better to give it a day. I t was way to blonde after assessing in my own mirror and not at all like I wanted or what the picture looked like and it felt like hay. I called the salon to which I spoke to the owner. She asked me to come in and said she would fix my hair (BTW the original stylist saw me walk in the door walked right passed me and couldn't even apologize or acknowledge me REAL PROFESSIONAL). Well she ended up just adding even more gold to my already over process blonde hay hair and pretty much turned it a nice gold\/orange color. AGAIN not what I wanted. The kicker they charged me $245 which is OUTRAGEOUS even for the mainline. Not only has this p[lace RUINED MY HAIR. I have had to do 2 color correction already costing me more money AND I'm getting married in 2 months. Thanks to this place my hair is destroyed. For the prices they charge they should educate their stylist a bit more. I hope they went out to a nice dinner on my money as they totally ruined my hair. STAY AWAY","stars":1}

The interior is nicely decorated like a trendy bar, and the dark lighting makes the place a lot more fancy then anyone would expect from a place that sells hot dogs.

We were a bit overwhelmed by the number of options. \n\nI ended up getting the Conquistadog, which had chorizo, patatas bravas (yes there were potatoes on my hot dog) and scallions, and it was amazing.

{"region":"EAST","text":"River House at Odettes in New Hope, PA: You Will Spend a Few Washington's Crossing the Delaware, but This Place is All Worth It!\nIf you like a gorgeous and modern hotel, some incredible views, and a top-notch restaurant than, boy oh boy, have I got the place just for you! The River House at Odettes is located in quaint, quiet, and historical New Hope, Pennsylvania. When my wife and I drove down to the hotel, the streets of New Hope were more crammed with visitors than the Seaside Heights Boardwalk on a sunny summer day! New Hope is a special place to visit with your entire family.\nThe River House at Odettes (Hotel Review):\nThe River House at Odettes is only about a year old as of the beginning of July 2021. It is a modern piece of architecture beautifully hand crafted from a wooden frame. The hotel itself is situated right on the banks of the scenic Delaware River. Even the panoramic view pulling into the parking garage takes one's breath away. Professional valet parking awaits you. From there, you head up the elevator (or the stairs) to the first floor in order to check in.\nThe front desk hotel staff is cheery and welcoming. The main lobby is a marble and wooden masterpiece with large bay windows overlooking the Delaware. Our premium suite was on the second floor, and I have to say our room was one of the most beautiful that I have ever stayed in. Our detached living room was as large as any living room in my own home. During the colder months, you even have your very own fireplace that lights up on command. Our front deck was huge (there is a deck off the bedroom too) and the vista overlooking the Delaware River and the surrounding Pennsylvania Mountains are absolutely incredible.\nOur suite was not cheap by any means. We did get to see some of the smaller rooms on our floor, and they looked simply fine if that is your thing. Not all rooms come with a beautiful walk out deck but many of the regular rooms still overlook the scenic Delaware. So, all in all I award a 5-diamond rating to the River House at Odettes Hotel. It is a place you will just have to put on your radar for the future.\nThe River House Restaurant at Odettes (Restaurant Review):\nDuring the evening we went (July 4th in fact), the dining room was under the command of Chef Nathan Kasubick. It was my birthday dinner from my wife, so I was really looking forward to a special meal. And, believe me, we got it!\nThe restaurant itself is quite beautiful and our table faced out overlooking the Delaware River. The ambiance and the d\u00e9cor of the place is colorful and enjoyable to the eye.  A lot of modern art deco paintings grace almost every wall. Nearby, in another room, is a well-dressed piano bar and the singer who was playing his acoustic guitar was piped into the dining room. It was quite nice and not overly loud or disturbing. The singer had an incredibly gentle and soothing voice too.\nBefore long, we were greeted by our wonderful waitress as well as Chef Nathan. The service was some of the best I have ever experienced in a hotel restaurant. As I looked around at everyone else on the staff, it was clear they all were on the same page. Believe me, I have been to so many restaurants where you think you are actually being served by The Three Stooges or the Keystone Cops!\nLynne and I ordered a beautiful and delicious bottle of New Zealand Pinot Noir ($75) to start out our meal. My first appetizer course was the escargots ($18) with anchovy paste, toasted pine nuts with a cashew and garlic butter. I told Chef Nathan later on that the escargots were completely submerged in the butter sauce itself and could not be seen. You kind of had to search for the snails themselves but other than that the taste of them was enjoyable. Lynne started out with a romaine heart Caesar salad ($16) with focaccia croutons and shaved parmesan. A traditional and classic Caesar salad does not come with cherry tomatoes on it but this one did. Still, Lynne enjoyed her salad very much. Chef Nathan then surprised me with an appetizer of smoked brook trout ($18) with pimento cheese and some delectable homemade focaccia bread for dipping. The dip itself was quite heavy with an over-abundance of cream cheese, so I suggested to Chef Nathan that he should make the trout the real star of the dish in the future. One thing he did accomplish was removing every single pin bone from of the trout. Remarkable accomplishment!\nFor our main courses, I had the most delicious and succulent seared diver scallops ($42) with fresh green curry, baby spinach, coconut milk with roasted peanuts and fish sauce. Chef Nathan promised they were real diver scallops, and they absolutely were! This may have been the best scallop dish that I have eaten in 15 years and please do not ask me what happened 15 years ago! My wife had the sweet and sour shrimp ala plancha ($39) with charred baby Bok choy. For your information, Plancha is a Spanish term for barbecuing or cooking at an extremely high temperature.

I scrolled their menu, and down at the bottom was the notation \"Jannie, copyright 2015.\" I called. It was them. We went. It was wonderful.\nNice decor. Great, caring service from \"Katie.\" Generous portions of the best C\/J food we've had since, well, since Jannie. Reasonably priced.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Not sure why this place has such low ratings. Maybe people secretly love it but then don't want others to come so then they give bad reviews to have it all for themselves. Selfish! ....But smart! ;)\n\nI will admit I'm not some coffee aficionado, but I would like to think I'm a coffeeshop-ambiance aficionado. So let's break it down. We have coffee and tea and specialty coffees (try the Mexican Mocha! A bit spicy and will send you off with warm fuzzies while simultaneously all caffeinated and hyper). We have basic food (bagels, sandwiches, salads). We have free wi-fi (stolen from the Radisson, but it works. - yup, just checked. 5 bars. solid). We have lots of plugs! Non-florescent lighting, yet not too dark. Lots of seating. Good music at a good volume. \n\nI'm one who can park it at a coffee shop for hours to do work and zone out, but I need the right white noise and \"energy\". This place has it! People come and go, sit for conversations, stay and work diligently on their laptops (perhaps writing yelp reviews), and it's a comfortable feel. What's not to like? Oh! And bonus! Beer! I came in today feeling bummy and wanted to grab a latte, but then remembered they served beer and it was an instant pick me up. Not that I'm an alcoholic or anything.  But it's nice to have options. And I haven't had a problem with the staff. It wouldn't hurt the manager to smile once in a while, but whatever. Maybe he has to show authority? Jk They've all always been friendly, though. They're doing their thing - not overly excited to see you or anything, but not the least bit rude either. \n\nWhen I moved to Philly earlier this year, finding \"my\" coffee shop where I can get away was on the top of my list to make me feel at home. I live in Northern Liberties but truck it over here cuz it fits the bill for me. Definitely have been and will be coming back.","stars":4}

This location beats them all out as far as I'm concerned.  Rather than the cafeteria style casual presentation common to Indonesian food in the area, this restaurant is sit down (though I'm sure you could also pick up if you so desired.)  The dish I ordered had rice topped with fried shallots and was flanked by a mixture of fresh haricot verts with bean sprouts and perhaps other vegetables in a slightly-spicy peanut sauce.  The dish also came with some fried marinated chicken (I think there's a marinade going on here of something like turmeric \/ galangal and shallot?)  It also came with rempeyek kacang - anchovy-peanut fritters which I took bites of with dabs of the house sambal.  I should make a note of the sambal because it had a very different flavor from all of the sambals I tried:  Slightly funky almost like Korean kochujang.  I can safely say it's my favorite condiment I've had in a while, but there were other pickled chiles and sauces at the table.  All of these came out to about eight bucks.

And then, as a remedy he said he would discipline the hostess (Alaina?). Frankly, I don't know that the hostess is the main problem, this attitude seems to reflect a company culture that doesn't respect women with babies or she would have been trained to accommodate someone in that situation (I know their policy is to not to seat until everyone has arrived, but c'mon). Missing the point, GM (sorry, I forget if his name was Dan, Chris or Mike) Although a (semi) regular at Wayne, I will no longer purvey establishments run by the 'Fearless Restaurant' group.  It's an incredible disappointment, but, as a woman and a mother, I don't think they deserve my business. Furthermore, when I told the GM that my friends and I will no longer be meeting for monthly brunch there (which we do without our babies\/ toddlers) he did NOTHING to try to retain me\/ us as customers.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Pleasant outdoor seating on a nice day to enjoy some craft beer and food. Picnic table style seating outside. Inside the restaurant, there is a pool table near the bar area. The nachos and wings were really tasty. The reason this place loses a start is because they aren't really accommodating to small children. The hostess told us that there are only 2 tables that allow high chairs and when we arrived they were both taken (by people with no children). We figured we would let the two toddlers sit in the double stroller while we ate but then we were told that we couldn't have a stroller either.

Delicious. The eggs were perfectly runny, the cheese was melted and gooey, the avocado was ripe. I'll be back for the food, but I hope the service improves","stars":3}

It cost me over fifty dollars for ONE order of chicken Parm (very bland and mediocre tasting) and ONE order of calamari- probably the WORST calamari I have ever had.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I saw the Little Mermaid here, and it's a historic theater with a lot of pictures around showcasing its history. That was really interesting to read, and I wish there was a side gallery or something for it because putting a bunch of photos on staircases and in bathroom entrances, so some were hard to read. Also John Wilkes Booth performed here, so that's a fun fact.\n\nI think because the theater was older, the aisles were really narrow. Some theaters you can stand and let people pass, here you basically had to have the entire row come out so people could go in. The play itself was good, well staged. It wasn't Broadway, but having the actors fake swimming and fake ships were well done to my eyes.\n\nThere are parking lots nearby but they range from like $10 to $30. I parked a few streets away for cheaper, so circle around if you can. There current COVID policy requires a mask + vaccine proof but maybe that's necessary to avoid shutting down. It's a nice little historic theater, so I got to spend the day doing some touristy things then stroll over here for a play, so it was a nice way to spend the day.","stars":4}

{"region":"EAST","text":"I had a pretty disappointing experience at this salon and wouldn't recommend it, especially for poc\/women with curly hair. I haven't had a hair cut in nearly a year and my hair has been getting a bit scraggly at the ends, so I booked a haircut\/keratin express treatment for a total of about $250. I also have an upcoming event and wanted my hair to be shiny and pretty, haha.\n\n I took off of work for the day to leave myself enough time for both of these services but ended up walking out 10 minutes after I arrived. First issue is that they scheduled the keratin treatment before the haircut, which should have been flipped. The woman who was supposed to do the keratin treatment told me my ends are \"too weak\" to work with. Okayyyy, so the point was to get rid of these \"weak\" ends today with a cut and strengthen the rest of the hair\/coat it in keratin. I straighten my hair sometimes and let her know I probably have damaged ends and would like to use the keratin treatment to lessen frizziness so I can leave it curly more often. She told me I was wrong about everything, that keratin treatments don't strengthen hair (??) and that I need to just be happy with my curly hair. Ummm ok! She also scolded me for using olaplex because it's \"only for lightening hair,\" which any knowledgable hairstylist knows to be untrue. Yes, it is added to the lightening solution but my own experience, in addition to the olaplex literature, tells me olaplex is awesome for repairing bonds in the hair resulting from heat damage, brushing, etc. She also made sure to say multiple times that she knows more than me, I obviously am ignorant about hair, etc. I really wasn't trying to be combatative, just telling her when I condition, how often I've had keratin treatments, and how olaplex has helped me retain length and such. \n\nAnyhow, she then brought her colleague over who tried to upsell me a bunch of things I already knew didn't work for my hair, and so after a couple of uncomfortable minutes of this I just ended up canceling everything and finding another spot since I could clearly see I wasn't going to get either of the services I booked, nor would I trust them not to mess up my hair (and looking at reviews now I see they have indeed really messed up other people's hair). \n\nUnfortunately, they just don't seem too knowledgable here and I could tell they had no idea how to work with my type of hair (I'm mixed race and I'm guessing they don't encounter this often?). I'd imagine I'm not the only person who has had this type of experience and I'm super taken aback given how pricy this place is. The focus seemed to be almost entirely on selling me products, which I clearly wasn't there for or interested in. Overall a disappointing and baffling experience.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I was looking for a great restaurant in order to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary.  Was not about to pay for unnecessary parking in center city Philly so naturally thought of the burbs.  Poked around and happened upon Eddie V's and I was not disappointed!\n\nMade reservations via open table and it asked if you were celebrating anything; entered the info and went on with my life.  For starters they offer free valet parking (though there is ample parking available at this location).  Check.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeting immediately and upon giving our name, were asked to wait 2 minutes while our table was properly prepared.  In less than that time we were escorted to our table which had been decorated with hearts and a card that read Happy Anniversary from Eddie V's.  Check.\n\nOur waiter Eric promptly appeared, introduced himself, wished us a happy anniversary, asked how many years we were married and went over the menu.  We were surprised with complimentary champagne for a toast.  Our orders were placed and the appetizers started to appear.\n\nHe had the lobster tacos which he described as absolutely amazing.  I had the crabcake which was perfect!.  Next he had the lobster bisque and I had the ceasar salad.  Both were delicious.  There was apparently some mishap with his steak and the manager came over to beg forgiveness, congratulate us, thank us for choosing to celebrate our anniversary there, and offer us complimentary shrimp cocktail which were 4 super sized shrimp.\n\nHe ordered steak and I ordered salmon.  I also thought it would be great to add additional sides (turned out I didn't need them) and ordered the truffle mac-n-cheese and brussel sprouts.  The food appeared and everything was delicious.  \n\nWhen we were considering sharing dessert, Eric brought over the most delicious bananas foster with, set it ablaze and told us to enjoy the complimentary dessert which came with a side of ice cream, had \"happy anniversary\" written in chocolate.  Everything about this meal; the decor of the restaurant, the vibe inside the restaurant, the service, and the food was exceptional!","stars":5}

Well he never called back after three calls over the week. So I called and spoke again to the guy in the second chair. He told me he would cut his hair. So we arrived and he says \"ooh you must be looking for Ron because he cuts your hair.\" My sin explained that he never called him back but at this point did that even matter just give him a hair cut. Well what a horrible hair cut... never washed his hair, never combed his hair in top to style it and cut him to close. He charged him $30 for a 10 minute horrible hair cut.

We actually had great experiences there in years prior to this last visit .  But this time around the was horrible and totally killed the experience.  The hostess staff and servers seemed very cold and unwelcoming from the very minute we walked in the door. The one barmaid was friendly and helpful to my questions I had for her about different brands they carried while I waited by the bar to move over to the raw bar counter. We were given a large white paper menu when we were seated at the raw bar counter and not informed by either the hostess or our waiter Todd that it (the menu) changed after a certain time after we were seated . After several rounds of apps from the raw bar and kitchen , we were ready to order our main meal and the waiter said \"oh you still have those menus\" without any explanation and walked away and returned with an abbreviated mid day menu.   No attempt to see if he could accommodate us since we were ordering off of the one they presented with since the time we were seated. Not even an explanation.  We would have ordered the large plate dishes up front if we knew that was the case.  They literally changed it up on us mid meal no warning of last call on the main menu . Only offering a very cold \"sorry\" from the waiter when I said I had really my heart set on a certain dish from the original menu we were ordering from . No attempt to even try and see if anything could be done. Nothing.  Just prior to the this I ordered a cocktail w a name brand bourbon and was told by the waiter they didn't have it and I jokingly pointed out to him that I can see the bottle sitting on the shelf behind the bar from my seat.  (It was front and center behind the bar) and he stormed away to see about it.  After that his demeanor really went from bad to worse and seemed really annoyed toward us and wouldn't make eye contact with us the rest of the time and was very brief and curt with us. After that we just decided to cash out and get the hell out of there because we were both extremely upset and it totally ruined our experience , given the attitude and the apathy displayed by our sever . I have to say ,the two fellows working the raw bar were extremely pleasant and were the only friendly people in the place we enjoyed watching them and interacting with them.  I actually wanted to put our severs tip into their tip bowl because they were the only ones who actually deserved it, but my wife said to just give it to him and be done with it I and reluctantly left it for the sever and we just checked out and left.","stars":1}

Who knew imitation crab meat would go so well on a crepe? My dining companion went for the gyro. Both were lovely.

I'm eggs and sausage or omelet kind of guy and to mess that up is pretty hard but I digress.  The other day the wife had the berry stuffed French toast....the French toast was only cooked on one side, which we questioned but was told that's how they did it.. well I don't make French toast like that so we wont be ordering that again.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I never had much of a desire to try Bikram, as I've been a power Vinyasa girl through and through, but when I stumbled on an amazing Groupon deal for this place I couldn't say 'no' to trying something new!\n\nI would describe this as 'tough love yoga'. The instructors will encourage you to not leave the room (even if that fresh air sounds *so good*) and hold off on taking a sip of water until after your first few poses (ahh but I'm so thirsty!) but they're only doing it because they care! I've taken classes with a variety of instructors and have found things I like about each of their styles. So far, I'd have to say Malea is my favorite. \n\nOne thing I love about this place is that there are people of all walks of life and all levels of skill who try it out, and it's truly a judgement-free zone. The series and poses are also broken down in such a way that the 90 minutes really do fly by. \n\nThe changing rooms do get a little crowded, so I would suggest having your change of clothes be loose and easy to get into and out of- definitely struggled with getting a pair of leggings over my sticky sweaty legs while also trying not to topple into any other locker room yogis after a particularly challenging class. It wasn't one of my best experiences. \n\nThis place is pretty great, tight spaces aside. Give it a try!","stars":4}

{"region":"EAST","text":"This is a very nice place for a special meal.  My wife and I both ordered the butterflied bronzino. It tasted very good.  It was light tasting, and not a bit fishy.  It came with grape tomatoes with a white wine garlic sauce.  I had an order of asparagus and spinach because I pass on the potatoes.  Both vegetables were cooked very well and were not too firm or too flimsy.  All in all it was a very good meal.\n\nWe also had the anti-pasta platter as an appetizer to share.  The cheese in particular was good, but the meat was tasty too.  I as not a big fan of olives but the tray came with a cup of them.  My wife enjoyed them.\n\nOne of the nicer things about this place is that it takes a while for your food to come so you can sit and talk for awhile.  It does tend to get a bit loud though, and the tables are pretty close together,\n\nThe service is always top notch here.  Everyone is attentive and treats you as a regular even if you are not.   The only reason this place gets four stars instead of 5 is that it is a bit pricey.  The good news is that it is BYOB so you save that way.  Wine is much more reasonable if you can bring your own.  To give you an idea of the pricing our fish dish was a special priced at $28.  The most expensive thing on the menu is the 8 oz. filet priced at $48.  I love steak, but $48 seems high for 8 oz.\n\nThe bottom line is Domani Star is a fine choice for a special occasion restaurant.  This one is on my list for birthdays and the like.","stars":4}

It's a great appetizer with a few sliced beets, carrots, and some small slices of avocado. \n\n- Steak - I asked for it to be cooked medium, and what I got was closer to medium rare, but the taste was still good.  In my opinion, however, the fries that came with the steak were the star.  Best tasting fries I've had in a long, long time!\n\n- Rum cake - small and light, but tasty, and a perfect way to end your meal!\n\nI will DEFINITELY be back.

Their pizza, which at one point was my absolute favorite, now has become habitually hit or miss. It used to always be a hit, hakuna mattata. Now I cross my fingers whenever I place my order.\n\n4. I've come to realize their other foods leave much to be desired. Their strombolis aren't seasoned. Their wings are weak. Their salads are for people who are meat-lovers pretending to be healthy. The same thing goes for their wraps. Their pasta is comparable to  a bowl of Barilla noodles with Ragu sauce without salt and pepper. Accu Pizza does two things right: Pizza and, well, they remember your address according to your phone number if you've called before....Ha, I do like their cheesesteaks though.\n\n5. Several times I've been disappointed with getting room temp food with delivery. \n\n6. They often forget to deliver EVERYTHING on your order. Be cautious when ordering sides.\n\nI used to love this place. Now it's become very expensive for a West Phil pizzeria that sometimes isn't worth to treat yourself to.

There are multiple floors so make sure you check them all out because they are all very unique. \nLittle piece of history ... the restaurant built around all of the original columns and the walls\/ceilings. They actually had their builder copy the ceiling design to be able to extend it throughout the extension. It's amazing so don't forget to look up. The ambiance is so romantic here and sets the tone for an amazing date night and\/or special occasion. \n\nDefinitely make it a point to use the restroom ... not because the restroom itself is anything special but because it's right next to the actual bank vault. The restaurant kept it and now use it for private events. It's really cool and you definitely have to check it out. \n\nOkay so onto the food ... everything is al la carte. \nWe decided on the filet mignon and scallops. Just an FYI you can customize anything here. So, if you want a surf and turf just ask them to add it to whatever steak you choose. \nWe tried a few sides. The lobster Mac and cheese, the Brussel sprouts, the onion rings and the mashed potatoes. Everything was amazing but a few of our favorites were the onion rings, believe it or not, and the lobster Mac. \n\nWe had to try dessert ... and we went with a recommendation from the waiter. It was the pound cake ... he swore by it and oh my god he was right. It was one of the best desserts we've ever had. \n\nI'm sure I don't need to say this after giving a 5 star rating but the drinks were delicious and the service was impeccable.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Very rarely do I order from this Starbucks just because of how long they normally take. However, this is perfectly understandable since they're located on city ave and when you consider the amount of traffic they get into their store. But when I do order, I am always displeased with quality of the drinks they make. As a former barista at Starbucks, I understand the pressure to make drinks fast and correct. However this also means it's hard not to notice when they haven't been made right. I ordered a grande vanilla sweet cream cold brew, a pretty simple iced drink. The cold brew flavor wasn't bold enough, so you can assume they cut it with too much water or got lazy and used ice coffee. They also used regular cream most likely instead of vanilla sweet cream, or simply didn't put any pumps of vanilla. I'm always disappointed when I order from here. So if you're not eager to wait 10+ minutes to receive a sub par drink, don't order from here. \n\nOn a slightly more positive note, when they're normally open, they're often very friendly, both in store and at the drive thru.

Their menu consists of mainly Chinese with some Japanese and Thai. I ordered the General Tso lunch combo that includes rice and an eggroll. The rice was well cooked and the evgeoll hot and flavorful.

Pair these with the burger and I'm dying happy.\nI know it's a good restaurant when  I a.) can't decide what to order because there are so many awesome things on the menu, and b.) wake up craving the food at 8am.

The now former owners were delightful and the food was consistently good and consistently fresh.  \n\nThe new owners appear to be lost in their own kitchen.  We ordered cold sesame noodles which were inedible -- a great knot of rubberbands dolloped with rancid peanut butter and what we hope were chives.  The scallion pancakes were similarly mutilated beyond recognition.  The beef in the beef and broccoli dish wasn't recognizable as meat let alone beef, and the vegetables were cooked to death. Most of our dinner went from the takeout cartons directly into the trash.  \n\nBut for me the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was the rice.  It was, at the same time, completely undercooked -- even crunchy -- and still incomprehensibly dripping with rheumy water, at the very same time.  What?!?  This is a CHINESE RESTAURANT and the folks in the kitchen can't prepare a decent and simple plate of WHITE RICE?  \n\nThe new owners are lovely people -- gracious and welcoming.  I know that they bought into Lansdowne as a break from trying to run an eatery in a rough section of North Philadelphia.  But they have big shoes to fill and, so far, the shoes aren't fitting quite so well.  \n\nPearl owners, please make some changes in your kitchen or Lansdowne will lose a landmark Asian restaurant.

Make sure you dress it up, I was one of three people wearing shorts at the end of a hot summer day. The atmosphere was beautiful, with its dim lightining and subtle luxurious artwork. The waitors seemed psychic- I came early for my rez and had to wait at the bar for 20 minutes.

Upon closer inspection, these employees are really good at communicating with their eyes in order to not put any stress on its customers.

I have to start bragging right there. It took me back to New Orleans, as is commonplace in NOLA (beers and \"buck a shuck\"). The oysters were fresh and plump, no sand, no shells bits, to intrude on our dining experience. Then onto some real appetizers, I had the \"Snapper soup\"(as in turtle). It was delicious and more, sort of beefy than I would have thought. It came with a side of cream that was brandied or the like, also some chef supplied little rolls to \"sop up' every last tasty drop. My wife had the clam chowder and we shared back and forth. It too was hearty w. a nicely garlic back side. \n  Then came our entr\u00e9e, I had the shrimp and grits and she had the steak Oscar. The steak Oscar was def a delicious cut of meat and who can resist the crab on top (classy). I am a country boy but grits were never a fav, the grits here with the poached egg and the bacon (fat back, as we called it, meaning thick smokey bacon) was a great accompaniment to the 3 large shrimps. Not a huge plate but surely quality food and along with all the others, there was not an inch of room for desert. I did have a second beer, so the lager on special (the brand escapes me, doesn't matter) was a hit.\n   We parked one street over on the side of the street and a small walk past the City Bar was an easy access.

Being that The Capital Grille was close, we decided to eat there. It was about 10:00pm and we had no problem getting a table and were promptly seated by the hostess and given menus. After about almost 15  we realized that no waiter had come to the table. We asked a passing bus boy to grab our waiter. A waiter quickly came over to see what the problem was. We explained to him that no one had come to take our order yet. \n\nIt seemed there had been a mix up between two waiters who were splitting our seating area as to who was waiting on our table. He couldn't be more apologetic. Within one minute there were two mini crab cakes at our table followed by prosciutto wrapped mozzarella and fried calamari. All of which was delicious. And all of which was completely comped. We weren't looking for any comped food but were more than happy to accept it. We followed with two delicious steaks. After the meal was complete two mini cheesecakes and flourless chocolate cakes arrived at the table. Comped. \n\nThat folks, is how you remedy a mistake. We were completely blown away with the service that meal. All we wanted to do was place our order, and would have been happy to do so.

Not only does he manage to juggle three or four different items at a time, but each is perfectly prepared. Additionally, he is a very engaging personality. \n\nBased on our own experiences, we will return again and again for brunch and based on the reviews here, we are highly motivated to return for dinner, too.","stars":5}
{"region":"EAST","text":"After visiting the breathtaking nearby arboretum, my friend and I were craving a delicious slice of pizza. We headed down Germantown to Cosimo's. We were warmly welcomed by the savory smells of bread and pasta as well as several friendly employees. We had a combo pizza with sausage, roasted red peppers and yummy mozarella! It seems like a great place for friends and family (they even have a corner of the restaurant set up with a TV with kid-friendly stuff on it). The crust was just the right thickness and the sauce was minimal, which is the way I like it. Overall an amazing pizza with incredibly fresh ingredients and yummy flavor! It's one of the main reasons I visit my friend in Philly (but shhh don't tell him!)","stars":4}

I needed labels printed however when I went to their copy center, I was told they could only print certain labels. I pleaded my case but received any hep or convenience. I will start using another printing place if this is the case.

(I asked for a feta bacon tomato omelet, and I got a feta tomato omelet with bacon on the side.)  I had to chase down the servers to get my coffee refilled, and then to get the check.\n\nThe food took a long time to arrive.  The omelet had a big glob of uncooked egg in it, and the bacon was burnt.  What was up with that bacon?  Did the cook not notice that he burned it?  Did the waitress not notice that it was burned? Or did they decide to serve it anyway and see if I said anything?\n\nThere were at least three kids who either yelled, kicked their feet against the furniture, or both.  That's not the management's fault.  But the restaurant also smelled bad.  And the seats at the counter were really uncomfortable.\n\nCoffee and omelet was $9.09, which is cheap.  Not cheap enough.","stars":2}
{"region":"EAST","text":"This is the old tolteca express, came in hungry at 730pm saw restaurant had changed so decided to try it. I have lived all over Latin America and traveled and eaten extensively. Aside from the fact that our food took nearly 2 hours to come out when the restaurant was only serving 5 other small groups, place about 1\/4 full. When the food arrived it was an absolute FAIL. The bandeja paisa had scrappy portions of meat canned beans and yellow rice with canned veggies, The sudera de pollo was underwhelming. My daughter said the meat on the enchilada hondureno I think.it was called, tasted worse than taco bell, and she hates taco bell. The fish tacos were ok, and the starter colombian empanadas were over priced  probably prefab\/frozen and the win of the night because even though tiny for 3 dollars each they were tasty and only took 20 minutes to come out, unlike the main course which we waited and waited on. After our waitress apologized for the insane wait and said the kitchen was having problems, I was surprised to find out the owner was in the restaurant, never came over, no offer of a drink or another app or let alone some kind of comp. Miserable dining both through taste and experience. It is a shame I was loyal to this previous establishment for almost 10 years.","stars":1}

My waitress was more interested in having a conversation with her friend then working. I was with a group of 6 ppl and every time we needed her we had to call her over (including to order food.) Then she took 20 min to WRITE the receipt out rather then print it like most locations. And to top it all off some of us wanted to pay with card and some with cash, she said it would be fine just write how much to take off each card but then she split the bill evenly on the cards. I can go elsewhere for better service when the food was just OK. The portions are big but that does not compensate for the lack of service.","stars":1}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Elegant setting, flawless service, and nicely executed, creative food. I had extremely high expectations, most of which were lived up to. There were four of us at my table, and we asked the sommelier to do wine pairings with every dish we ordered - this involved us all drinking five glasses of wine and was probably the highlight of the meal. Good thing we were walking home!\n\nThoughts on the dishes my table ordered:\n\n*Spinach gnocci - I can see why this is one of the restaurant's signature dishes - probably the best thing I ate all night\n*Sweet onion crepe - this is another dish they're famous for. I thought it was tasty, but it didn't blow me away.\n*Cauliflower flan - just ok, but I'm not much of a cauliflower person, or a flan person for that matter\n*Squid ink rissoto - didn't really have much taste to it. Seems like this is a delicacy that's on the menu for novelty's sake because it literally didn't have any taste\n*Salt crusted branzino - delicious! and the brussels sprouts that come with it are cooked to perfection.\n*Roasted baby goat - quite yummy, tender and flavorful, crispy on the outside\n*Chestnut fettuccine with wild boar ragu - yummy homemade pasta, wild boar ragu had nice flavor\n*Stuffed pappardelle with shaved foie gras - this was also a nice choice\n*Desserts - all were very good, especially the apple fritter and chocolate souffle\n\nMy overall sense is that you have to come here willing to spend a good sum of money to get the full experience. For example, you would probably need to get an antipasti, full order of pasta or secondi, and a dessert to walk away satisfied. It's not cheap, but this is truly a case of getting what you pay for - everything is homemade, the service is impeccable, and you are treated to a rare experience of what food can be when it's done at the highest level.","stars":5}
{"region":"EAST","text":"Easily one of my favorite places in University City. The margaritas never fail you, the food always leaves you full and satisfied, the atmosphere is fun and social, and the servers are always cool. \n\nThe trick about Mad Mex is to only go during the deals because then you have a huge meal and drink for ~$13. There are two main times to go, afternoon for happy hora (4:30-6pm) or late night (10pm-12am;11pm-1am for student discount). During happy hora, margaritas are $3.30(tax included) for 12oz and $7.70 for 22oz. Here's the trick: get two small ones and then you get more margarita for about a dollar less. During this time there is also half off wings. I highly recommend the San Francisco wings. For late night there are two deals going on: first, from 10-midnight you have your well know Big Azz margaritas (the 22oz for $7.70). There's also a deal on beers I think. From 11pm-1am, if you're a student, you get half off anything you order (excluding tacos, chimis, and fajitas I think) with your student ID. Warning, they only give you one half off entree per student ID. So go during the sweet spot, 11-midnight, and you will be one smart cookie. \n\nI was a regular for the past year and got to know a fee servers on a first name basis. Shout out to Angel for always being the best. If you have her, trust you are in great hands. \n\nMy personal recommendations: every month, they have a seasonal margarita flavor. March is Kiwi, and it is the best I've ever had, hands down. Please get your margaritas frozen. It's just so much better. Next, I get the Jersey Chips (waffle fries) with a friend, so we each end up paying $1.75 after the student discount. It comes with a spicy cheese dip (amazing!) and ranch. Or get the chips and guac. There guacamole is really yummy and has large pieces of avocado and onion. If you have a group of more than 3, split the nachos.","stars":5}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Horrible horrible experience. Took 15 minutes for our server to come back to our table and take our order after getting us drinks. Our food took 45 minutes after that to actually reach our table, and they forgot my one roll. Additionally, I asked for a roll with just jalape\u00f1os and cream cheese, and instead they put both of those ingredients in my other two rolls. When I asked questions about this when I only received two rolls, they just brought me another roll without the \"added\" ingredients. At the time of paying, I asked for clarification on my receipt, as I felt it wasn't fair to pay for items that I did not want just because the server did not clarify with me. The server used a bulls*** excuse when I confronted her, saying that usually customers can understand when they're busy and that I'm new so I didn't know \"how things work.\" I've been in customer service for quite some time, and even if it is busy during a rush, there's always time to double-check with someone who is paying to eat at your establishment. It felt as though that she didn't care about the customers, and instead was just on autopilot. Me \"being new\" doesn't excuse horrible customer service. The server never once apologized, and instead made me feel badly because she screwed up. I will never come back, and I caution everyone who comes here to be wary if you plan on deviating from the menu even the slightest.","stars":1}

I asked how much an iPhone case was and they gave me a range of prices for the one I pointed out.  I asked again how much it was.  'We'll give you 15% off.'  But what's the price?  I think the issue here is the manager on Sunday afternoon has terrible listening skills.  Went in circles and everything about this place screams SCAM.\n\nFinally, one of the store clerks was attempting to sell me the new iPhone at a higher price than Apple even had it for.  Nah, no thanks.  A day later the manager informed me that the $85 trade in value that he offered should have been $300.  Pretty sure I got overcharged in an activation fee, too.

I have looked confused, in need of help, and with money to burn, and no ones come up to me.

The ingredients are sourced locally, organically, and as freshly as humanly possible, and although this is mostly a comfort food-based menu the attention to detail, proportion, and presentation is fantastic. \nAlthough you really can't go wrong, I highly recommend Jeb's open faced biscuit sandwich. It's a veggie-friendly item that satisfies even the most die-hard carnivore, and as one of the most inexpensive items on an already reasonable menu, the value is unbeatable.","stars":5}

It's kind of hidden off the street a bit, but it's recognizable from the outside with the rainbow colored chairs and fountain.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Grilled Octopus.\n\nCame here with a friend for dinner one evening.  We had a reservation and walked into the very packed restaurant.  I was here once when it opened but then I took a good break until this second visit.\n\nAs the review begins, we had the grilled octopus appetizer.  I have to say that it was one of the most splendid things I've had.  It was very tender and in a sauce that had good texture and complexity of flavor.  I did think the price was a bit steep for the portion size.\n\nMy entree was good but I think I wanted it to be better.  I had the fried chicken and while the chicken was cooked perfectly, it was the batter that I took issue with.  It seemed cake-like in a way and I felt it was a bit too heavy.  The collards along side of it were very tasty.  My friend had the lamb shank and I didn't even get to try it because apparently it was so good he tore through it before I got the chance to get a piece.\n\nService was excellent.  The wait staff was very pleasant and accommodating.  I like this place and it's very unique.  I shall return.","stars":4}
{"region":"EAST","text":"I can't find a good Chinese restaurant down here.  If someone can help - seriously - please message me, because this one ain't it.  Yes, I know \"ain't\" isn't a word; much like Asian Grill isn't clean, or particularly good.  \n\nI'm actually tiring of writing reviews for bad Chinese restaurants; I feel like I'm typing the same things over and over, and am kind of at the point where I want to say \"the food is shite\", and move on.  Sadly, that isn't who I am.\n\nSo, o.k., the shrimp toast is good.  If I stopped here, we'd be at four stars.  It comes as a sizeable portion, albeit in the bizarre format of three pieces, horizontally sliced, that are heavy on filling and light on bread.  It isn't saturated with oil, and is totally par for the course.  Egg rolls are pretty much the same everywhere, and to possibly channel Yogi Berra, so are these.  I'll include a mention of the sweet and sour chicken here as well, since all of the above is basically fried junk food, and that was fine, too.  The sweet and sour sauce doesn't have much going on in the sour department, but it very rarely does, wherever you go.\n\nActual Food Not Involving Fryolator: \n\nThe fried rice is yellow, and if you read my reviews, you will know I think yellow fried rice is inferior.  While there are exceptions, this is not one.  For starters, there is no egg, which is JUST FUCKING BAFFLING to me.  Also, infuriating, if you couldn't tell.  I've had both the chicken and pork iterations, and I do prefer the chicken; the char siu here is almost completely devoid of flavor.  I say \"almost\" because, in the most recent instance, it tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for two days.  And you know what they say - there's no pork like old pork.  Do they say that?  If they do, it's only because it's nasty.\n\nThe pork lo mein is made with the same pork as above, only cut longer.  This one didn't taste slightly turned or like smelly refrigerator, but like anything at all.  If there were such a thing as stringy tofu, it could have been that.  There are almost no vegetables in this dish: a miniscule amount of nearly evaporated sprouts, three pieces of either scallion or garlic chive in the entire quart, and a small number of celery slivers. That was it.  Not even a lonely canned water chestnut.  Also, it was overcooked, so the noodles were too soft.  If I may borrow one of yours, I would like to give this three thumbs down.\n\nThe hot and spicy beef, warm and not particularly spicy, has a sauce that is mainly ketchup.  Yes, actual ketchup; if I had to guess, Heinz.  I'll just end this one here.  Anything more would be a superfluous addition of insult to injury.\n\nThe General Tso's chicken was not even a little spicy, but otherwise what it should be.  In other words, edible, but probably not what you're expecting.  This could be repaired by knowing in advance, and telling them not to forget the peppers.  Assuming they have them, that is.\n\nWhat else?  I might have blocked some of it out.  Oh, yes - I also ordered hot and sour soup here once.  Again, not very hot, but a little sour, and full of what I think were sliced button mushrooms, as opposed to shiitake and wood ear.  Edible, but wrong.  I don't recall seeing any pork in there either, come to think of it, but maybe that's just as well.\n\nAll in all, first impressions at Asian Grill are correct.  You walk in, it looks bad, and it's not great.  I'd say to go with your gut on this one, and if not, trust your eyeballs.","stars":2}

The price was really high so I told them I'd get everything done somewhere else because my friend is a mechanic and I'll only have to pay for the parts and he'll do it for me and when everything is done I'll bring it back to finish the inspection. They told me that if I do that it will cost me $30 to bring it back to finish the inspection and I said that was fine.

Beautiful night so we requested the back outdoor patio. 30 minute wait turned into 1+ hours but killed time at bar. Bartenders were friendly and patient. Good traditional margaritas with salt and also nice selections of craft beers offered as flight of 4 for $9.50. Unfortunately had to keep checking with hostess on table availability. Patio was nicely secluded from Rte 70 and landscaping with uplights provided nice atmosphere. This probably contributed to patrons staying well past acceptable time and delaying table turns. Finally was seated and looked over huge menu. Again friendly well mannered waitstaff. Ordered carne asada enchiladas and for the life of me couldn't find enough meat in the dish to deserve the description. Fair to average sides of rice, beans and wet lettuce. Whole plate was really just a pile of something that could've been bought at a fast food chain (would've saved waiting time also). Wife ordered shrimp tacos (3 served). She couldn't remember seeing many\/any shrimp on the dish. Non offensive but unsatisfying. Daughter ordered enchiladas and once again a large portion of no substance.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I brought my car in to get fixed. My front bumper needed to be replaced and the back bumper needed to be sanded and painted. Dave reassured me that it'll come out looking brand new. 3 attempts later and my bumper is still a different color than the rest of my car. The first time I gotten my car back after they had it for 10 days, they attached a black grill (I originally had a silver one), my trunk wasn't closing properly, and the bumper color (maroon) was COMPLETELY OFF. I went back in and had them re-do the bumper and replace the grill. The color was still OFF. Dave blamed it on a previous body shop that had painted my bumper yet when THE OTHER body shop painted it, it matched perfectly. Dave then explained that he would need to blend the painting and asked for MORE money. When I refused, I was then asked to bring it in for a THIRD time for blending to fix the error. I went to pick it up on the same day and Dave brings my car out to me and says \"sorry we didn't have time to wash it\" (that wasn't the point I didn't care if they washed it or not) I just knew they absolutely did NOTHING to my car the THIRD time around and brought it out to me as is. No blending job is going to take a few hours and look exactly the same because the bumper still didn't match. Be careful with this company they're a bunch of crooks!!! Esp if your a female. How dare you put a different color grill on my car then when I asked for it to be changed act like it's an inconvenience to you. After the third time I had just had enough! Lesson learned!

We waited until the day-of, and the only timeslot left on a Saturday was 11 PM. We took it because I heard Barbuzzo was amazing, but we were definitely uncomfortably starving by then.\n\nThe restaurant is extremely tiny. I was sitting approximately 6 inches away from the table next to me, and it's very difficult to get in and out. It definitely feels nicer if you're here with a party of 4, but I felt like everyone could hear everything we were saying.\n\nWe got the bone marrow, which was good but definitely overpriced for how little you get. Per everyone's recommendations, I got the stuffed meatballs... they were just okay and too spicy for me. I unfortunately didn't understand the obsession with them! We also ordered the vesuvio, which was pretty tasty but small. I really liked what they did with the broccoli we had in the vesuvio -- that should be a separate dish (though I notice it's not on the menu, but maybe they threw it into ours since we were the last table of the day). My boyfriend absolutely loved their famous budino! I wish I liked desserts; the budino can get pretty heavy if only one person is eating it. \n\nOur server was pretty good, but we ended up pouring ourselves water most of the time.

The inside of the restaurant is dark, with dim lighting. It has cool wooden beams on the ceiling. We were seated immediately and our waiter came in over and took our drink orders. He was very nice and made good conversation with us. \nMy husband will only eat steak if he has A1. So we asked if they had some, and unfortunately they did not. They had their own version of steak sauce. This is something that irritates me. If you want to have your own steak sauce or ketchup, that's fine, but still have a couple bottles of the store bought kind. So instead of ordering a more expensive steak, he ordered the chicken. I also ordered the roasted chicken. The waiter recommended the hash brown side, and the Mac and cheese. So we ordered both. After we ordered, biscuits were brought out with butter. The biscuits were really good! The were sweet and flaky and had perfect salt flakes on top. \nOur food  took quite awhile to arrive, about 30 minutes. The chicken was absolutely amazing! My husband and I agree that it was probably the best chicken we've ever had in a restaurant! It was flavorful and the skin was crispy, and it  had a nice sauce with a few roasted potatoes and carrots. \nUnfortunately the side dishes were not good. The Mac and cheese  was some of the most awful Mac and cheese we've ever had. It has smoked Gouda cheese in it and that's all it tastes like. Smoked Gouda is a cheese that you should use very sparingly, and probably not in Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese is a delicate dish that you can do a million different things with like adding toppings or mix ins to jam pack flavor in, but at it's core, it's still a delicate dish that shouldn't be overpowered with a cheese like smoked Gouda. They also didn't put bread crumbs on it. Mac and cheese is always better with bake with bread crumbs! \nWe also ordered the stuffed hash brown. It was giant. It probably weighed 3 lbs! Unfortunately, it wasn't great, just ok. It's stuffed with sour cream and then fried. It needed salt so badly! This is their signature side, and it was mediocre at best. \nOverall, we didn't have a bad experience. The chicken was absolutely amazing! But the sides sucked.

I travelled 30 minutes there and spent another 30 just waiting to test drive a vehicle.  Then they said \"We don't have the car for you.\"  Typical old style car sales people who just want to get you to buy something you dont want. The smug look on their faces and the disengagement.

Yesterday they called and left a message asking that I call back to confirm the reservation. \n\nWhen I called back, I was asked for a credit card to hold the reservation and that if I cancelled I would be charged the full amount of the reservation and issued a gift card in that amount. \n\nThe best part was when I then said to cancel my reservation, the girl on the phone said \"you mean you don't want to keep your reservation???\" As though she was shocked and that how dare I cancel at this top notch restaurant. Absolutely rude and condescending. \n\n\nI have no problem using a credit card for a reservation. My problem is that this policy is nowhere on their website, and they all of a sudden need a credit card. In my opinion, they saw a demand for tables and decided to enact this policy. They waited until a week before Thanksgiving so that people would not have a choice. Well guess what - we do have a choice. I booked my table of 8 elsewhere, AND happily left a card number to confirm, because this was made known on the original reservation call.\n\n\n\nBad business. Greed will get you nowhere.","stars":1}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Let me start by saying this is my first Yelp review ever. I also work at two high-end restaurants in the area and this would never occur. Dined here for Mother's Day brunch and my family had a 1:00 reservation for 4. At about 9:30 that morning, I found out I was able to join my family for brunch and we called the restaurant asking if we could change our reservation to a party of 5. The hostess told us that they may not be able to get us a table for 5, but we could add a chair to our table. We called last minute on a busy day, figured if we had to squeeze in at a table, that's fine. It was our problem. My family and I were seated in a corner banquette (split booth). Our server tried to accommodate us by asking her manager if we could be moved to an empty table. Manager told her no. I sat on the end, with hardly any table space and had to have my body turned the whole time to eat\/drink. Once again, it's a busy day and we changed our party size last minute, our problem. However, as tables got up to leave and staff cleared and reset the tables around us, we watched as those tables sat empty and were not turned. About half way through our meal, about 75% of this restaurant was empty. No one asked us if we wanted to move, no managers checked in on us, and there was no real effort made to accommodate us. Someone could have offered us a table and given us a timeframe of when they needed us to leave. Instead, we got nothing. Also, we checked in on time, 1:00, for our reservation. We were not seated until about 1:30. By 2:30, the server was hovering over us to pay. A one hour turn for 5 people is unacceptable, ESPECIALLY SINCE THESE TABLES WERE NO LONGER BEING TURNED FOR BRUNCH. I get it, you had dinner at 3, but c'mon- what did you expect to happen when you end brunch at \"1:30\"? Unfortunately, I will not be back.","stars":1}

The entire thing was all cheese with a small glob of sauce on top. I even requested extra sauce (I love my pizza saucy!) which they completely ignored. The toppings are $2 a pop.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I have to be real, initially the thought of Indian for brunch turned me off but because my parents (I SWEARRRR I have friends and go out with people besides my parents even though I'm sure that's becoming hard to believe) are picky AF (even though they blame ME for being picky, LOLOLOL) this became plan B.  \n\nI'm honestly writing this review right now so that I can procrastinate doing the dishes. Classic.\n\nWe walked in and were seated. Immediately \"spicy masala bloody mary\" caught my eye. WTF?!?!? NOM!!! Do they even NEED to have anything else on the menu? \n\nThe really dope thing about this place is that they have brunch classics but with an indian twist. Super super cool. Where the fuck else can you get shit like that? But...seriously, where, tell me.\n\nEggs are an essential component of brunch for me and I appreciate the flexibility of going with one of the \"(certain # of eggs), (choice of preparation style), (topping choices)\" option. Here it's 2 eggs, I went with scrambled, and abiding by the \"when in rome\" attitude, paneer and spicy chiles. I also swapped the home fries with masala fries. I'm salivating at the thought. Well, either the thought or the fact that I just decided I'm going to eat some of those semisweet baking chocolate chips after I write this. Needless to say the food supplies in my apartment are scarce at the moment. \n\nDespite a decent instagram photo with the accompanying location to make sure all of my followers know I made it to philly, I actually was surprisingly and disappointingly not keen on the bloody mary. The flavors were odd and drinking it actually felt more like a chore. The mimosa or champagne or whatever the people at the next table got looked REALLY good, I would get that next time.\n\nWhen the food arrived I had that immediate pit in my stomach (might have been the bloody mary actually) when I realized I forgot to tell the waiter that I wanted my eggs well done to the point of near combustion. Sigh. I settled on playing russian roulette with the soft and almost liquidy scrambled eggs. \n\nDespite my ordering oversight, my eggs were fantastic. I would prefer more firm eggs but the paneer and the spicy chiles presented very unique and enjoyable flavors. I've certainly never had scrambled eggs like this before. I must admit, eggs can get a bit monotonous over time. \n\nThe eggs were accompanied by this beautiful, fluffy, and delicious naan...piece? slice? loaf? The masala fries were shoelace thin and crispy. I would have preferred a stronger seasoning flavor but I am a sucker for condiments\/spices. I also would have preferred more of them be present on the plate and then subsequently in my digestion cavities. \n\nI don't recall what my parents got unfortunately and in order to retrieve this kind of information, that would require me to call them and it's past their bed time. HOWEVER, whatever constanza got had this really delicious, light peach-colored sauce. I LOVE SAUCES!!! I dipped a few of my fries in there. By a few I mean a Lindsay Lohan \"few\". That might be a joke only I understand. \n\nFuck, I just realized I still have to do the dishes.\n\nBye\n\nPS-no salmonella from the eggs, dope","stars":5}

The lot and inside were pretty empty, so we were seated promptly by a bearded fellow who was so monotone, spoke quickly as if we knew what he was saying and left.  Thankfully the waitress was way nicer and prompt.  Ambiance wise everything in the building gave you the typical chain feel which is fine with me.  The bathrooms were a tad dirty for being business being so dead.  I'm a firm believer if you have time to lean you have time to clean and I saw a lot of leanin' here.\n\nNow to my food thoughts!\nLet me just start by saying I was a fan of the little bread rolls they brought out to start with a flavored oil for dipping.  For starters we ordered two cups of soup, mine was the Sweet Italian sausage, rice, tomatoes, spinach, onions & garlic, topped with mozzarella.  It was decent, but lacked flavor.  Entr\u00e9e wise my wife selected the grilled salmon and felt the same way.  It was bland, but decent and edible.  I ordered a special Lobster Insalata white pizza with fresh mozzarella, topped with a salad of North Atlantic Lobster & arugula in a lemon vinaigrette which I enjoyed.  That came in at $21.99 and I made two meals out of it.  It was a good looking pizza and all of the flavors described above were there, it just lacked the \"brick oven flavor\" a bit.  I'm thinking the ingredients probably call for an earlier exit from the oven than usual.\n\nI think pizza wise Bertucci's is a safe pick, they seem to do that well, but for me they need to step up their game flavor wise on their other items to make spending $19.99 on a salmon dish and $4.99 on a cup of soup worthwhile.  There are many local restaurants that would make my money go further and overall experience worth forking out that money.\nI'll return to try out their staple brick oven pizza's some other time.","stars":2}

Especially for a restaurant like Cantina Laredo, which advertises itself as a upscale or \"modern\" Mexican place. Does modern now indicate tasteless and disappointing? That is the only thing Cantina served.\n\nThe website touts the margaritas as award winning, and they were fine. Not the worst, not the best. What sort of terrible margaritas exist in Philly that this earns an award though? The service was negligent and slow, but that seems to be the norm throughout most of the PHL airport (we spent quite a while here). The server seemed annoyed that we were there, she didn't check in on us at all, and she almost threw down several items in her haste to escape our table. The hostess was friendly, but took a while to acknowledge us standing in front of her, since she was busy talking to some other airport employee dude hitting on her. She continued to flirt with him for most of our meal. \n\nWe ordered the chili queso dip, which was pretty decent but started to congeal quickly. I had the spinach enchiladas, which consisted of limp, tasteless spinach wrapped in a tortilla with some sauce. Boyfriend had something involving chicken, which was also completely tasteless.  He salvaged it by mixing together all the components of his meal and the remaining queso dip. \n\nThis place is not worth your time or money. Weirdly, the silverware is plastic.

I was lucky that the market wasn't jam-packed, so there was plenty of space and no line. \n\nOkay, but back to the ice cream. I asked the cashier what she recommended and she said her favorite was Butter Pecan, but that the Salted Caramel Pretzel was one of their most popular flavors. You get two scoops, so I got one of each. To be honest, the Butter Pecan let me down a bit. It was creamy, but I wanted more flavor. More pecan flavor? More sugar? I don't know. Now, the Salted Caramel Pretzel...well, that was EVERYTHING. Lots and lots of little chocolate-pretzel pieces and salted caramel. I kept saying, \"I'm not going to finish this because there are other things to try in this market,\" but hell...I couldn't stop. That ice cream was addicting.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Ok... I will admit, there is not much Stephen Starr can do wrong in my book, and this is yet another example of why his restaurants are my favorite in the city.\n\nI have gone to Dandelion a handful of times last year, but it had been a while so, when I saw they had available reservations on Friday night, I figured it'd be nice to return.\n\nWe sat in the \"dogs' room\", which is quite cozy, my boyfriend even sat in an armchair. Not that it really matters as food is obviously the primary concern at a restaurant, but the decor makes this place feel comfy and definitely British.\n\nWe started off with the ricotta appetizer. Both my boyfriend and I are fans of the ricotta appetizer at Stella, so we knew we were going to love it here as well. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was even better than Stella's. It was pure creamy deliciousness, served with toasted sourdough bread. Amazing.\n\nAs an entree, my boyfriend ordered fish and chips as it is his favorite at Dandelion. It was a great dish as usual aside from the fact that he only got one piece of fish. \nI ordered the lamb bolognese even though I hate lamb. I figured, if anyone is going to make me love a dish with lamb, it is Starr, and I was proven right. It was served with orecchiette pasta, and the whole dish was truly incredible. It had chucks of carrots (a true bolognese) and there was a ton of meat (I hate when they skimp on the meat when you order bolognese). \n\nWe were so stuffed after our meal that we skipped dessert but ordered another round of drinks. \n\nOverall, another great experience at a Starr restaurant, and I cant wait for the next time!","stars":4}

We stopped in ahead of our event to see the selection and ask questions and the man in the store was so helpful. He showed me everything and made suggestions. He went over prices and talked about how to best prepare everything for us to serve at home. We went back 2 days later to buy what we needed. The woman employee was equally as helpful and made great suggestions. She told me about the garlic sauce for the clams which was out of this world. She told me to best serve and prepare everything. We bought 4 dozen little necks, 2 lbs Upeel shrimp, 16 crabs and garlic sauce. Everything was amazing. The price was $155. A great value for fresh seafood. We will definitely be back","stars":5}

For some reason, every time I've gone since around Thanksgiving, the food has not been good and even a couple times, inedible (and I hate wasting food). \n\nI know it could be a \"bad night,\" not enough staff, etc. so I keep giving it another chance hoping it'll be great like it used to be. But, with the prices of food going up and the quality going so far down, I can't say I'll return. I've had too many orders of almost totally black-burned fried mozzarella, cold and soggy fries, orders of Buffalo cauliflower with more styrofoam box than actual food, mac and cheese seems like microwaved noodles with shredded cheese on top? It seems like the kitchen is trying to short cut things. I'd say maybe this is just me but my household feels the same way. \n\nMy last visit was last weekend. The specials (which should be extra fresh) seemed microwaved. The potato soup special was actually cold and just not good, tried to not waste it but I just couldn't eat it. Fish and chips were alright. Buffalo Mac and cheese just tasted like dry, cooked pasta with hot sauce on top. On top of it, the younger staff is friendly BUT they usually seem too preoccupied with serving beers to larger parties of people rather than serving customers in small groups looking to order food. Waited 25 min. to order, and 15 min. for a spoon. \n\nI really hope Gaul finds a good, consistent chef, doesn't take short cuts (I'd rather wait 45 min. for take out if it's actually good), and focuses on it being a restaurant more than a watering hole.

They come with a spicy ranch dipping sauce which you really don't even need to enjoy them.  We got the Buffalo wings, pork ribs and the perogies & kielbasa for dinner.  The wings were huge and full of meat.  The buffalo sauce was spicy and a little sweet, different but very good.  The pork rib dinner comes with two sides.  We got the collard greens & parsley potato - unfortunately they were out of the parsley potato (they are on a first come first serve basis, so when they run out of something they are just out) so we got the chuckwagon corn instead.  The ribs were delicious and very meaty.  The sauce was perfect and the meat fell off the bone.  The perogies & kielbasa came with a side of sour cream.  You really need two sides for this dish, its huge.  The perogies & kielbasa are in a bbq spice with shredded cheddar on top.  The meal is to die for.

There's an outdoors area as well as a large indoor area. You can stand around the bar or grab one of the many tables. They have tables for 2 up to whatever your party is honestly. \n\nFood:  Friends ordered the burgers, I've had fries and pretzels. The food is probably a little better than bar-quality (I'd give it all a 6\/10). It gets the job done! You can definitely come to Yards for a sit-down dinner, but its more of a hang-out place with beer and friends.\n\nDrinks: I've had the IPAs, saisons, flights, etc. here.

Bartenders know much about their own beers!\n\nService: Great service, quick, efficient\n\nPro tip: if you've never been to a brewery before, take the $5 tour. They'll give you close-toed shoes to put on top of your shoes for the tour. You get a free beer and a beer koozie at the end of it. I went on the tour in September and the guide was hilarious.

I hit up the trusty ole Yelp app on his I-Phone for a recommendation. We were both craving Italian, and Modo Mio showed up as the first 4.5 star rec. Conveniently, it was also in the same hood that my friend was having her bday party. Finally, as an added bonus, I found out this place was BYOB, which means that Josh and I could splurge a little more on food instead of spending 50 bucks on a bottle of booze that really cost 15 dollars at the distributor. \n\nWe arrive at like 7:30, sans reservation. All the tables inside were booked, but we were able to sit outside right away. It was a touch too hot to eat outside, but by that point, we were starving. The waitress explained that a lot of people try the 'tourista' menu. For 32 dollars, one can get: an app, pasta, an entree, and dessert. For Josh, who can eat a lot, this seemed like a good value. Knowing myself, I stuck to an entree. I could have ordered pasta if I wanted, however, because they have GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS! Yay!!!! They can do any spaghetti and gnocchi dish gluten free, which ROCKS. However, the lamb shank and wilted dandelion greens combo looked pretty outstanding, so I chose that. Josh went with: snails and capers over toasted bread, shrimp and arribata gnocchi, breaded pork loin with gorgonzola over corn, and vanilla panna cotta with biscotti for dessert. We were both super pumped. \n\nWhat we loved: Josh loved his snails and the cheesey bread that accompanied it. He also liked the gnocchi. He said that it had a small spicy kick, but that even someone as spice sensitive as me could have handled it. He loved the pork, especially because it was covered in gorgonzola. I was kinda meh about my lamb. The lamb itself was cooked perfectly, but the accompanying tomato and plumb puree was a bit cloying. Josh's pork dish looked way better. If only the breading were gluten free. Otherwise I would have gone halfsies with him. \n\nAll in all, this place was super cute. You could tell that they care a lot about food. If my lamb were not covered in that saccharine sauce, I would have easily given Modo Mio 5 stars.","stars":4}

But hey, what can you do when there's really no other competition in the area for decent Korean food? Go capitalism!\n\nI've been here at least 3-4 times in the past 2 months with family and we always order a lot of food so I got to taste a fair bit amount of their menu which is large (or average for Korean restaurant standards). I thought their dolsot bibimbap was really good. I didn't think they put in enough quality veggies but the flavors were still pretty good. Their nengmyun is pretty good too (probably the best in the area) so they have that going. \n\nThe Korean BBQ is very expensive and you don't get a lot for what you pay for. And this, I am comparing not just to other Korean restaurants in the area but also LA. The meat quality is decent to good (not amazing) or better than the Philly Korean BBQ average but the amount is pathetic and the taste is so-so because of their marinade. It came across as too strong, too marinated. I'm all for Korean BBQ marinade but it has to be done right. Otherwise, with great quality meat, no marinade necessary.\n\nService is alright and they'll change out the grill without bitching unlike some of the Korean restaurants in LA. They're pretty attentive with cooking your meats for you or filling your drinks but when it gets busy in here, you'll have to remind them a few times for refills on the banchan or salad mix.\n\nI'd probably keep coming here but will probably stay away from their Korean BBQ option as it's way too expensive to be worth it.

The atmosphere is pro-Philly - as long as you're wearing the colors, you can talk to anyone, high-five everybody, and berate anybody wearing out-of-town gear.","stars":5}

The nachos aren't drenched in liquid cheese like you often find them but topped with fresh tomatoes, radishes, jalepenos, etc. Very flavorful in its own way. Margs are good and relatively strong. I think what really gives this place that extra oomph factor is the ambiance. From the lighting to the hanging plants, this place really makes you feel cozy and relaxed.

Fabulous food, cute atmosphere, vegan and vegetarian options with plenty of options for meat eaters, ice cream (and assorted types of floats), lots of old-fashioned soda flavors, breakfast\/brunch (rare in this neighborhood at the moment), and reasonable prices.  My one and only complaint is the hours -- they close SO early!  Sometimes I want to run over and grab a sandwich when I get home from work, which isn't even that late on average, and they're already closed.

{"region":"EAST","text":"There is a known issue on some 2020 RAV4 Hybrids that this dealership has chosen to deliberately ignore and not reveal to potential buyers. I purchased my new RAV4 Hybrid about two months ago from this dealer. After a few weeks, when the gas gauge read empty, I filled up the tank only to find that the car just took 10 gallons, not the full 14 gallon capacity. After researching this, I learned that not only is it a know issue, but there is a pending class action law suit against Toyota for this very problem. Neither Angelo, my salesperson or the sales manager revealed this issue when I purchased the car. They know about it, but since it is not yet an official recall by Toyota, they never mentioned anything. \n\nI bought this car for its Hybrid range - advertised at well over 500 miles per tank. There is no way to achieve this since the gas tank only fills to about 2\/3 capacity. So, the gauge says empty, but it is not. The dealer should disclose this. They are choosing not to.\n\nI asked the dealer for either a refund, a replacement vehicle that does not have the problem, or a reduction in my monthly lease payment. They declined any remedy. Toyota claims they are working on a fix, but refused to back me up and told me my only option at this point was to file a lemon law complaint, which I have done.\n\nIf you are shopping for a RAV4 Hybrid, please inquire about this problem.\n\nThis dealership should know better than to sell a vehicle with a known issue like this.

I am not a big red meat guy anymore after 5 years of steak house heaven in Dallas. When I get a craving for meat there is no better place than Tony Luke's. Many argue that the roast pork is the call. It is good but will still give the nod to Dinic's in Reading Terminal Market. I am not he best judge here since I am not a roast pork fan. Back to the beef. The Steak Italiano is just about the best sandwich on the planet.  It all starts with the right roll. Not sure what bakery they use but the roll is big and just the right texture. Not quite as good as a Sarcones roll but works on this sandwich. Next to the meat. Good quality rib eye sliced razor thin. Cooked as is and not all chopped up like some other places.  And lots of it on every sandwich. Next is perfect balance of broccoli rabe. Cooked up with some garlic and olive oil and no bitter bite here. Then some great slivers of aged sharp provolone that really gives this sandwich character. It just does not bet any better.\nAs a kid the Steak Italiano did not exist. You got either Wiz (yuck), American Cheese (how un-Italian), mozzarella (for pizza) or domestic sliced provolone. And no one used broccoli rabe. And there was no Tony Luke. Back in Philly after over 25 years away I have really enjoyed the great food throughout the city during the last year. But I am not sure what tops the Steak Italiano for quintessential Philly food.","stars":5}

They offer whole wheat tortillas for any burrito, and will add their delicious signature hot sauce or sauteed veggies to any wrap you want.  They've never masqueraded as truly \"authentic Mexican\" - they've always sold nontraditional burritos like the veggie burger burrito or the American burrito, but they're worth the trip nonetheless.  \n\nPlus, they participate in the U.S. Airways milage program, so if you register your cards with the program and eat lunch at Santa Fe, you earn flyer miles for every dollar you spend!","stars":5}

I mean they still try to get you in that back for a \"Private dance\" where it is you and her, but they are not as demanding as the other places. Basically they are here , because they really don't want to hang it up. Yes there are some attractive ones , then there are some that shouldn't even be there. \n\nThe space isn't that big, it is probably the size of a living room and a bedroom put together.

The next day I called again and was again sent into voicemail. Again, no one got back to me. So that afternoon I went in and the attitude was that they had no fault and it must be my error. There was not even one offer to look into the matter, sorry for your inconvenience... etc. It was simply that I must have made a mistake.\n\nI think this is what bugs me the most - the automatic assumption that the error was on my part and no one would even bother to call me back to figure out what may have gone wrong resulting in me having to go in person.

This year I thought, maybe there's a service that will deliver a tree for you? Googled it and found Mike's company. \n\nI think it can look a bit pricey when compared to picking out your own tree, but the price is warranted as they are delivering and setting up the tree for you - and it's obvious that they groom the tree prior to delivery for a perfect shape. They also cut the stump right in front of your home so it is as fresh as can be. Mike was so friendly and helpful, carrying it up the stairs for us and giving us tips on watering it for prime freshness. The tree (pictured) is absolutely perfect (delivered on 30-NOV and still looks great) and I will definitely be using them again next year!","stars":5}

{"region":"EAST","text":"This is a review of the Bike Line of West Chester store which is now located at 117 Turner Lane, West Chester, PA 610-436-8984.\n\nI was in the market for a new 3-bike trunk bike rack, and after compiling a list of a few compatible models, I visited this store.  I was greeted by an associate Greg, who quickly impressed me as being very knowledgeable about such a product.  We zeroed in on two racks--the Saris Bones 3 and the Thule Passage 911XT 3 Bike--which are both excellent, high value racks.  I decided to go with the Saris Bones 3, but before completing the purchase  Greg on his own went on Saris' web site, and discovered the following manufacturer's vehicle fit note related to my sedan: \"2 BIKE \/ 70 LB LOAD LIMIT. Bikes must be located in positions closest to vehicle.\"  Of course this meant I could not use this rack to carry three bikes without risking significant damage to the car.  I was extremely grateful Greg determined this, as I was planning to use the rack the following day.\n\nAccordingly, I purchased the Thule Passage 911XT 3 Bike rack, along with three stabilizer bars to carry my wife's and two daughters' bikes.  Greg then reviewed with me some important elements regarding proper installation.  The rack was easy to install and load, and performed flawlessly during two legs of highway driving.\n\nAs seen above, I had a very positive experience at this store, due to extremely competent associates like Greg and I am sure others.  This store should strongly be considered to satisfy all of one's biking needs.","stars":5}

Not only was she providing slow service for a practically empty bar, when we did have the displeasure of being served by her she was curt and obviously annoyed by our presence. She refused to get another drink for one of us because 'by law' she could not fill another drink before we finish the first. We all work in the service industry and know that this was untrue, just pure laziness. Two members of our party ordered waters and when another person asked for one she blatantly said no, kindly pointing out that we could all share the two we already received.

We have been to Sanghi before but haven't been back in a while so didn't know if it would be the same. It was actually better than we remembered it to be :)\n\nWe both ordered the same dish as our main- the jja jang myun (black bean noodles) and an appetizer called tang soo yook (korean styled sweet and sour pork). You have the option to choose the tang soo yook in either beef or pork but the original dish was first created as a pork dish and I've always found fried pork to taste better than fried beef so I always get the pork version. \n\nBoth the noodles and tang soo yook were delicious! The sauce on the noodles was amazing and although the noodles weren't hand made they were nicely cooked. This type of noodle is not supposed to be al dente so don't be disappointed when it's not. \n\nSometimes depending the restaurant the tang soo yook sauce is too sweet but sanghi's sauce was perfect. The pork was fried just right- the batter was crispy but light and the pork tender. \n\nGiving it 4 stars because I haven't had a chance to try more of their dishes but from what I've experienced so far, it's one of my favorites for jja jang myun in the Philadelphia suburban areas :)","stars":4}

On my 2nd visit to this place, the food quality has gone down the drain.\n\nFirst dish we ordered was Daal which was served cold and just boiled. We asked to keep it mild and they just boiled it and served it. When we asked why was that so , the management said that's how mild daal is. In my 20 years of eating out at Indian restaurant no one has ever benchmarked spice level with taste but these guys do. So make sure if you say mild they will serve you boiled stuff with no other condiments in it\n\nSecond dish was Chicken tikka which seemed to came as sizzling on platter but it was all raw inside. Could see the pink raw meat\n\nThird dish was paneer tikka makhani which we decided to keep as kadahi paneer style per Servers recommendation - the dish came out someone just mixed chunks of paneer with red tomato without even marinating and properly cooking anything\n\nFourth dish was Sham Savera - whatever those balls were made of had very chewy and hard texture to it. Almost it felt frozen and days old. I have had sham savera before and it's usually melting and soft. This was something else\n\nWe returned the first three dishes but we were so starving after waiting for almost 40 min for our food we decided to eat Sham savera.

The one thing that drives me back the most is the Roast Pork Bun and their smoothies!\n\n Bread Top's smoothies are fresh and made with real fruit unlike some other places in Chinatown where you are paying $3.50 - 4.50 for powdered and syrup drinks. At Bread Top, drinks are $3.00 to 3.50. I highly recommend strawberry, mango and watermelon.\n\nTheir watermelon smoothie is a refreshing drink only offered in the summer.\n I wait for the summer just to have this drink! It's that good!\n\nAlso, their cakes are delicious if you are ever need an Asian birthday cake. =]","stars":5}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Without sounding wacky, Double Knot was so sexy. The space was creatively done beyond what any picture could describe. The food was well prepared, not overly trying, and while ingredients were simple the flavors sang; being Japanese I am sometimes overly discerning, but here, I was overjoyed. If there was one negative it was that the tables were simply too small to accomodate the amount of food we ordered and the staff still seems to be getting adjusted to service\/timing that bussing didn't keep up and some lapses when lots of dishes would arrive and then long pauses before we saw anyone again. However, I won't hesitate to recommend Double Knot with a shoutout for my faves of shishito peppers, edamame dumplings, scallop sashimi, and pork belly robatayaki!","stars":5}

In addition, the wings take a long time to prepare and don't expect your order to come out in a short amount of time. From my understanding, this has nothing to do with the restaurant, but just that the process involved in preparing Korean Fried Chicken is time consuming. \n\nIn terms of the ambiance, it is a bit dark and they have K-Pop blasting.

The service was awesome!  Chef Jeff was so friendly and we really enjoyed talking to him. \n\nOur burgers were gigantic. I had the standard cheeseburger which was thick (around 8 ounces) and juicy. Unlike other places, Phinny's has rolls that actually FIT the burger and held together to the last bite!  My husband had the mushroom Swiss burger which was loaded with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Both burgers were cooked EXACTLY as we requested. Sweet potato fries and regular fries were so good, cooked well done and crispy. We loved the big slices of real dill pickles that came with our food as well. My husband had the boneless chicken wing appetizer.

If the folks at Poke-Man got in a race with a turtle, a sloth, and a snail, all three would lap Poke-Man before they even got two feet out the gate. The first two times I got food from here I ordered online. Delivery was perfect. Pickup was crappy because the food was not ready when it was supposed to. And eat-in was horrendous. Order and wait twenty minutes to a half hour or more for a poke bowl. Poke is supposed to be one of those \"fast casual\" type things. Just about every other poke place in the city will prepare your bowl in front of you as you order. Not here. Order at a register, then wait. They'll make it when they get to it. Which might be tomorrow.\n\nIn all seriousness, the choices of proteins here (seared cajun tuna, for the absolute win!) beats every poke place in the city. There is by far more variety here than anywhere else. Flavors are top notch. That being said, I would NEVER, ever eat in here again. The service is just THAT bad.

When the lady who would later serve us (presumably one of the restaurant owners) was standing by the door, my friend could not get up to go to the bathroom. I asked her politely if she could move to the side so my friend could go use the restroom, she told me in a very rude voice to \"just wait\" (not sure what she was doing...). \n\nWe were also told that we would have to vacate the table in 45 min (although it turned out no one had reserved our table)\n\nWe were later joined by two other friends who did not eat an entree (but four of us ordered appetizer, entree, dessert and coffee, spending over $30 per person), but at no point in the process did they have to make ANYONE wait on a table or turn anyone away because we were \"taking up\" their precious seats. I suppose this was still enough reason for them to categorize us as customers who came to take advantage of their restaurant. Our candle at the table was never lit, and every one of our dishes was served with a good dose of contempt. \n\nWhen the bill came, we were quite surprised to find corking charges and roughly 20% gratuity added to our bill (neither was mentioned anywhere on the menu or by our server). When we politely inquired about these charges, we were yelled at by the restaurant owner (presumably husband of afore-mentioned lady) that he had been in the restaurant business for over 20 years and that we were not in a position to tell him what to do. \n\nFood was decent but by far did not offset even a fraction of the terrible experience.","stars":1}

We were seated nearby the door placed too close to other tables so that we were bumped into the whole night by other customers and staff alike. Sadly our server seemed overwhelmed as he messed up our drink order and it took 20 minutes to get the missing beer delivered to our table. Fortunately, we did have chips and salsa shortly after we were seated and they were excellent.\n\nI had the chicken chimichanga and absolutely fell in love with it.  For an additional $1 you can get cheese, guacamole and sour cream.  The guacamole was pureed (not something I personally prefer) and was pretty bland.  I thought that this was almost impossible for guacamole since I love avocados.  Fortunately the dish comes with a bit of pico de gallo which, when mixed with the guacamole, creates a perfect side or topping to the dish.  \n\nThe other people at my table were not as pleased as I was.  The pork carnitas tacos were overly fatty, greasy and bland.  The tortillas seemed to soak up the excess grease and it really needed some spicy heat and any kind of textural contrast.  The quesadillas were pre-made (according to our server) and the filling was inconsistent (large pepper in one, pockets of beans in one).  \n\nI got the tres leches cake and it was pretty good but not my favorite. It was a little bit dry and not as dense as I like. The flavor (like pretty much everything else that night) was a bit lacking. The fruit garnish was not completely prepped (I got a couple strawberry and blueberry stems). \n\nThe only thing I can say for certain is that this restaurant is ALMOST there.

That's fine, I did need some money to tip the guy who is going to drive my car and it just got me a little bit nicer of a car wash. Then after I tipped the guy who dried my car I was ready to pull over to vacuum my car which is what I was really there for and he told me that it cost another dollar to do that.

Pinocchio's is celebrating 60 years in business and definitely still possesses that vintage feel.  Once inside you will find a small bar counter that seats approximately 15, a good amount of larger size booths as well as some tables mixed in.  There is also a large window that allows visibility into the pizza shop.  This feature serves as a great attraction for the kids, especially if there should be a wait (i.e. Friday nights).  \n\nWe love their pizza, wings and cheese fries.  My wife will sometimes audible out and go for the chicken finger salad.  All are great and also relatively inexpensive.   The kids are also provided with dough balls to play with while waiting for dinner.  Who isn't up for the challenge to try to construct the perfect snowman out of pizza dough.\n\nP's also has beer garden with an applethera of offerings both in bottle and on draught.  An issue I find with many restaurants that offer a wide selection of crafts beers is that they usually do a poor job of communicating to their patrons their expansive offerings including descriptions as well as updating once rotations have been made.  P's on the other hand, recently added flat screen monitors that display up to the minute availability of their brews w brief description.\n\nWe love this place.

Los Taquitos de Puebla is too good to miss, and just as the cuisines of Puebla and Veracruz (neighboring states in Mexico) have marked differences, not least of which are the differences in local agricultural products, no two South Philly tacos are exactly alike. \n\nI had an order of tacos al pastor, cooked on a kabob-like rod and containing a unique blend of seasoned beef and pork. They were served up with delicious nopales (a popular cactus dish) and two fabulous salsas. Go for the roja! Go for the fire. \n\nAn order of cebollitas preparadas (little grilled onions, seasoned) can really round out a meal, especially if you can share them with a few friends. And for your drink, grab an agua de horchata: a milky, rice based drink made with cinnamon and lime. Sooooo good. It's pretty rare to find \"real\" homemade horchata these days.

A Sabrina's brunch!\n\nThe good news is this one follows the successful recipe of the other Sabrina's caf\u00e9s. Humongous portions of delicious, satisfying food.  I had a wonderful Asian style salad and a cup of chicken noodle soup. The chicken noodle soup was served at the perfect temperature, not scorching and not lukewarm. It had a nice bite to it, and the salad was huge with a delicious orange Asian vinaigrette.  The other dish that impressed me at our table was the french toast.  The short platter was probably enough for three people, and my friend had added chocolate chips. It turns out with their pancakes, waffles, and French toast that you can add as many toppings as you like.  Beware of the pancakes though... I saw some on the line when we entered the restaurant, and they looked like huge dense frisbees.

{"region":"EAST","text":"Disclaimer: The pizza here is not your standard thin crust that most places in the area have. With that out of the way, I have been coming here for 20 years and it is great. The guys that own the place are usually making the pies and it is consistently good. The pizza may have a thicker crust but the sauce is amazing and fresh and the cheese is always a nice golden brown. The other menu items are great, too. The Caesar salad is huge, barely able to be finished in one sitting, and goes great with the buffalo chicken on it. The wraps and burgers are consistently good as well. The cheese steaks may not be a true Philly cheese steak with whiz, but they make the cheese steak with American and it is a great alternative when you are trying to do some one stop shopping. Can't go wrong with their daily specials for dine in if you can put up with the waitresses being sub-par the majority of the time. The food really is amazing though.","stars":5}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Absolutely wonderful. I can't think of another place I'd rather have dinner right now.  \n\nWith most new restaurants like Sbraga and Alla Spina chasing innovation and frankly falling on their faces, it makes a restaurant experience like this -at a time like this - even more refreshing.  \n\nInventive cooking is important and defines American cuisine, but Popolino reminds you that simple, fresh, traditional food cooked to perfection is a beautiful delicious thing.\n\nThe tavola calda in the middle of the dinning room tells you right away that there's no pretense here and we aren't going to take ourselves too seriously,  this might as well be your own house.  It also tells you that everything here is going to revolve around the food. \n\nAnd it does.  Everything kills.  From the first antipasti that hits your mouth-in my case the perfectly prepared vegetables from said \"tavola\" like sweet and sour carrots and balsamic mushrooms (vegetarians rejoice), the bucatini which you bite and say \"oh my god, THATS al dente\" slathered with honest fra diavolo that splatters all over the table cloth (because hell this is your kitchen and this is amazing), cannelloni not stuffed with drab ricotta that makes you full and bored after a mouthful, but instead with a light and lively herbed pureed cauliflower. the veal saltimbuca was the best I've ever had, the eggplant rolatini fantastic.  The desserts were great.  \n\nEverything on the menu was simple and fresh, a handful of ingredients, cooked perfectly, based on recipes that are hundreds of years old for a reason.  No decorative flourish scribbled on the plate, no imprim\u00e9 tower sticking out of a pile of risotto leaning at the same angle as the torre di Pisa.  Just a plate of noodles, a fork, a spoon and some grated pecorino Romano.  Half as expensive as anything else this good.  \n\nAre you listening Vetri?\n\nBut forget all of that- The bread,  oh my god, the bread!  If that was the only thing they served i'd go back and pay the same bill.  The yeast in the Biga starter might have fallen from God's rafters.\n\nI have had two dinners that were very similar to Popolino, one in Rome the other on the edge of Florence- neither had heard of Michelin (or vice versa).  Both bursting at the seems with belly laughs and wine and pasta and bread from heaven, and people who stayed for hours.  \n\nNow there's one in No Libs.\n\nThanks Peter and Ernesto.","stars":5}

The green tea wasn't made correctly so the taste was a bit off no matter what changes were made. Finally, the seasoned employee made me a black milk tea with bubbles. I'd never tasted black milk tea but I was very pleased with the bolder taste. I come here often and besides customer service, it is an excellent bubble tea shop. The teas are normally made very well.

The very front dining area (it's an octagon with vaulted ceilings) is really beautiful, especially when it's warm out and the back dining area is candle lit and really romantic. \n\nSecondly, they probably have the best service of anywhere in the area. The food is brought out quickly and the presentation is always really lovely as well. Everyone loves the guacamole made at table-side, of course. It's nice because if you don't like a lot of cilantro (like me) they'll put in a little less for you. \n\nI really am struggling to think of anything I disliked in the three times I've been here, it's always a really fun and tasty experience.

A dental liaison comes in and tells me and gives me an estimate for 9,300 dollars of work needed but no worrys they sell dental insurance.   I ask about my tooth and finally a dentist comes in and tells me I-need root canal.   I explain I don't really think so just have a simple cavity.   They numb me up to fix my cavity and after he's done drilling I realize he prepared my tooth for a crown.   I asked why and he said your going to have a root canal right.   I said no but now I'm stuck and need a crown and can't leave.

During my stay I visited the hotels sad excuse for a fitness center on a Sunday night. When I left, my iPhone must've either fallen out of my pocket or I mistakenly left it in the room. The hotel was pretty empty, I did not see any other guests walking around because it was pretty late at night, and there was only a contracted company of carpet cleaners in the hallway. When I realized my phone was missing I went back to look for it and it was gone. I went to the hotel front desk and they took a report, then informed me the hotel has no cameras or security of any kind (great!). They also tried to hide the fact that they knew it had to be someone in their own staff or part of that contracted company, but they were very bad liars. Luckily I only had my phone stolen and wasn't attacked in the hallway by a stranger. The hotel pretty much told me to call the police and that their insurance would cover the loss. I was supposed to hear back within 3 days and when I called I couldn't get a straight answer or a call back. It's now been 6 days and nothing.

{"region":"EAST","text":"The Reverend Dr. Steak and I headed over to this  new dining spot (occupying the space formerly the home of Auspicious & Silver Spring restaurants) for lunch today.  The new owners have done a nice job brightening up the place, keeping the bones but removing the obvious Asian references that the previous restaurants had.  \n\nAs they've only been open a couple of weeks, they are still feeling out their menu.  In a wise move, they haven't over-done the options, choosing to keep to a single page of options with a specials board.   Having said that, it's obvious that they haven't quite settled on their restaurant identity.  Why do I say that?  Well, any restaurant that has falafel,  a hamburger and a pear & walnut tart on the same menu is either  a) a diner or b) still figuring itself out.   This is a BYOB, folks, with no apparent corking fee.\n\nWe were seated promptly and our server did a very good job keeping up with our table.  This place is super clean and bright, have I said that?  The Rev. got a hamburger, rare, and I ordered the falafel as an appetizer and a chicken parmesan sandwich.   All were very, very good.  \n\nThe chef disclosed that the hamburger, rare, kind of fell apart on the grill, which is a rookie cook thing, he clearly (and happily according to the Rev.) was using fresh  meat and few to no binders.   He gave us the option of recook which we declined as the Rev. does not care that much about the state, more the content of the burger.    He made happy carnivore sounds as he ate, which I'm taking as a good sign.\n\nThe falafel balls were NOT overly deep fried - i.e. to the consistency of a hush puppy - which gave them a nice, light flavor and also the tendency to fall apart.  They're not quite Desert Rose, but then again Desert Rose makes sweet love to their falafel cooking them patiently in an iron pot, which not many places do.  For fried falafel, it's very tasty. \n\nThe chicken parmesen was also quite good, sauce was very sweet, not overly acid-and-tomato, roll was nice and crusty and chicken pieces were not overly breaded.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a nice addition to the Ardmore scene, though these folks will serve themselves well to settle on their identity soon. They're on a tough street for 'pub food' with three other 'pub' places within a block, so I'd encourage them to go creative and think of things that their direct competition isn't doing already.  Just be sure whatever you do, execute it well.  \n\nI'm looking forward to our next visit, perhaps to check out their dinner menu.","stars":4}

Ordered dinner tonight a little before 6:30 through the Slice app and decided to give this place a try due to a great deal that was available on wings. After placing the order I was contacted directly by the restaurant to say they could not honor the deal as priced due to increases in supply prices. I was then told it would be about $10 more. I told them I understood but would like to cancel the order in that case. I was disappointed at that point but it is what it is. After a good 20 minutes of the order not being canceled, I contacted Slice to see if I had to do something on my end. After the Slice agent reached out to the restaurant, I was advised the restaurant would now be fulfilling the order as originally priced. Since my original order was estimated to arrive at 7:40, I naturally added an extra 20 minutes to that delivery estimate to account for the original issue. 8:00 passes. 8:10...8:15...8:25. I contact Slice through the app again to see what is going on. After the Slice agent contacts the restaurant I am informed that unfortunately they just didn't make the order yet. They had apologized and would make and deliver it now. I decided a refund was a better option. In short confirm all marked prices, have a recourse to be refunded, avoid delivery, and you just might get food. Probably not, but maybe. I can't speak to the quality as I wouldn't know.","stars":1}

I was pleasantly surprised that there weren't that many people at Joy Tsin Lau, and don't let sparse crowd determine the quality of their food. \n\nJoy Tsin Lau has standard Chinese dim sum options. I recommend the siu mai, shrimp dumplings, honeycomb tripe, spare ribs... But, honestly, just pick whatever dishes look good to you and try 'em out. Dim sum carts were passing by us very often, so our service was excellent. Next time, I would like to try some of their fried dumplings that are fried on the spot. Both of us shared about 7 dim sum containers for ~$25 total. Kind of on the high end when there are many filling rice\/noodle dishes around $6-$8 in Chinatown, but for the variety and experience-- as with the nature of dim sum-- it's a nice treat. Especially when they serve it by cart, and not \u00e0 la carte... see what I did there. \n\nThe decor here is, well, vibrant and peculiar.

Then you'll see a mahogany divider on one side, calligraphy on another wall, red lanterns everywhere, and a TV that's always showing a Cantonese opera. I must say that looking around the restaurant does help time fly when waiting for food. \n\nI suggest coming here during the weekday for dim sum because the weekends get pretty crowded (typical of any dim sum joint). But if you must go during the weekend, expect for a long wait time for food to come to your table.","stars":4}

Not the end of the world but I thought by making an appointment I would avoid waiting. \n\nMy pedicure was good. For my nails she started giving me an acrylic refill which I didn't request, I just wanted a gel polish change. She'd done a few nails before I noticed so I didn't say anything and just let her finish. I showed her a picture of the exact way I wanted my nails shaped. She started to shape my nails the way she wanted so I said, a few times, can you do them like the picture. She just kept saying yes square he he he like something was funny. Needless to say they weren't quite the way I wanted. When my nails were done I noticed the middle finger on my left hand was sooo crooked like way to the left and it certainly wasn't that way when I arrived. \n\nThe ambience of the salon is nice and the fact that they give complimentary water and drinks is nice but I really just wanted my nails done the way I like them. It certainly wasn't worth the $60 I paid. I will get my nails done here again but with a different technician next time.","stars":3}

{"region":"EAST","text":"I really, really like Parc. The reason I've given only three stars is because I've had two subpar lunches here, which detract from the fantastic dinners.\n\nParc has a perfect location right on Rittenhouse Square. The decor, the outside tables...it takes me back to my favorite Left Bank cafe everytime I go. Service is very good, and the staff is knowledgeable.\n\nArrive early or be sure to have reservations, even on weekdays. If it's nice outside be prepared for a long wait if you want an outdoor table.\n\nThere is an expansive wine list. Personally, the house wines (all French), are reasonable, good, and come in convenient half carafe and (yeah, like I'd order a half...) full carafe sizes are what I'd opt for.\n\nThe four or five dinners I've had at Parc were all phenomenal. The big classics, like boeuf bourguinonne and coq au vin, were spot on (and yes, I AM comparing to places in Paris and New York). I've ordered the Lyonnaise salad several times. Frisee lettuce, crispy lardons and potatoes, and a PERFECTLY poached egg...you know they've got good staff in the kitchen when a dish that requires so many technical elements comes out perfectly.\n\nOn to the negative :-( I've had two really bad lunches at Parc. Not terrible, given the great atmosphere and service, but definitely a huge difference from the dinner experience. The onion soup (honestly, how can you fuck THAT up?) was grossly oversalted. And I'm not talking an extra pinch or two. Burgers were overcooked. Fries were overdone to near disintegration. I made the comment (purposefully) loudly enough so our waiter could hear that \"the B team must be on station today.\" The waiter looked at me sympathetically, and shrugged his shoulders as if to say, \"sorry man, but what the fuck can I do?\" \n\nBottom line: Go in the evening, get a table outside (weather permitting!), and enjoy the excellent dinners. Hopefully Stephen Starr reads this and gets on his midday staff. Parc currently reigns as the best French bistro in Rittenhouse since Brasserie Perrier folded.","stars":3}

I began working in Media for this summer and made my first appointment to come during my hour lunch break. I was in and out in 50 minutes with one of the best manicures I have ever had in the 13 years I've been consistently getting acrylic nails on. I've had the same technician each time I have gone (3 times now) and she never disappoints, I don't know her name but she has the station closest to the OPI polishes! All of the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating- they also offer a selection of beverages. The salon is very clean, welcoming, and I've always had an appointment but I never have to wait to be seated, not even a minute. The second time I visited, an issue arose where a large number of my nails' gel polish chipped within 3 days of my manicure, when I came to have them touched up they quickly sat me down, removed the gel, and repainted them at no charge.

Vesuvius, this time with coffee and vanilla ice cream. There wasn't that many people in line like there usually is, but we waited longer than usual for our sundaes after paying for them. The place seemed a little unorganized this time. They were calling out sundaes that no one ordered. Eventually some girl behind us took a sundae but wasn't exactly sure if it was hers. He said it was a small sundae and she said she didn't order a small,  but she'll take it anyway. He said sorry about that, she said that's ok. \n\nSo we got our mt Vesuvius sundae after waiting a little while and took it to our car. I was hoping to get 2 cherries since we told them we were splitting the sundae and asked for 2 spoons. We got not one, but zero cherries. I was trying to figure out what tasted off about the sundae. I did like the coffee ice cream in it but the vanilla ice cream tasted plain, it's usually more creamy. I said next time we will get other flavors instead of vanilla. I didn't realize till the next day that they also forgot the malt powder along with the cherry. My husband said he realized it when we got back to the car, I said I would have went back in if I knew. \n\nWe might just stick to going to the S.S Franklin fountain at spruce street harbor park when we go there in the summer.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I was visiting my parents in South Jersey from California and had a craving for Mexican food.  Being from California, I have a high bar for Mexican food and my parents suggested Jalapenos.  We ordered takeout for chicken enchiladas, cheese enchiladas and a seafood chimichanga.  In general, the food was decent but I'm handing out three stars for this one for a few reasons:  1.  Pretty pricey for basic Mexican cuisine, 2.  The enchiladas were dry (not enough sauce), 3.  Cardinal sin for a Mexican joint:  No tortilla chips and salsa.  Entrees range from $13-$19.  As a benchmark, one of our favorite high-end California  Mexican restaurants ranges from $15-$20 and this food does not even compare.  The whole point of an enchilada is the saucy goodness.  So, where's the sauce!!!?  The enchiladas we ordered were dry and get this...if you want more sauce, they charge you for it.  Seriously!!!?  So, make a dry enchilada by skimping on the sauce and then profit from it by charging for more sauce!?  Bush league.  Note to owner:  You will not go bankrupt by adding a couple more tablespoons of sauce to the enchiladas.  Finally, if you dine in, the restaurant will give you chips and salsa.  If you take-out, they will not.  Why???  It's not like you are paying any less for take-out.  Some advice to the owner:  Stop nickeling and diming your customers especially when your prices are already sufficient.  Add extra enchilada sauce, give chips and salsa and you will endear yourself to customers and create loyalty for them to keep coming back for more.  Skimping on basic things that are not going to cost you a whole lot will turn people away, like me.","stars":3}

We're not talking a tiny half slice you would normally expect as a sample... they cut you a big enough slice of bread to make you feel full and to buy an entire loaf of whatever slice of bread just devoured.  That's what happens to us, anyway!  \n\nThe monkey bread seems to be their top seller although I enjoy they savory breads like the pesto asiago which comes in a circular foil pan and is absolutely covered in cheesy goodness.  We tried the pepperoni loaf for the first time yesterday as a sample slice and bought an entire loaf to take home.  I should also note that these breads freeze very well and toast back up as if it were fresh out of the oven.  \n\nWhile the price point is a little steep, once you feel how heavy each loaf is, you realize that you're really getting your money's worth.

{"region":"EAST","text":"I took the wife here this past weekend for a late lunch and we had a great experience.  \n\nThere was adequate parking in the side lot.  We were quickly seated in one of the front rooms.  The staff was great considering the room was just about full.  They constantly checked on us and topped off our water.  \n\nThe server was prompt, made recommendations and quickly had our drinks out.  \n\nWe both started with the Lump Crab Bisque - dill and fontina melt.  My mistake was not asking if it was a bowl or a cup!  It was a bowl and was very filling.  It made me regret ordering an entree.  The fontina was very thick, it could have used more crab, but overall I found it to be good.\n\nFor an appetizer I also had a Stuffed Portabella Mushroom - crabmeat, roasted red pepper, fresh mozzarella.  I found it to also be filling, but not worth the price tag.  There was a good balance between the stuffing, but the crabmeat was lost in the cheese and mushroom.\n\nThe wife had a half sized Caesar salad for her appetizer and gave it a thumbs up.  Caesar Salad - romaine heart, cherry tomato, croutons, shaved grana padano, parmesan dressing. \n\nI had a few bites of my entree ... Chicken Schnitzel - panko breadcrumbs, buttery mashed potatoes, spinach, lemon caper sauce\u00a0at 27 before I asked for a to-go container and threw in the towel.  I was stuffed.  The Schnitzel was a big flattened portion of Chicken and the butter sauce was used as a nice melted compliment for the warm bread that we were given to start off with.  \n\nThe wife knew best (as usual) and ended with the Grilled Lamb Chops - green onion, apricot balsamic reduction at $19.  I should have gone the same route.  Shame on me, they were delicious and would have rounded out my meal nicely.  \n\nA couple rounds of drinks and our choices will put you in the $130-$150 range.  \n\nI had to laugh I wanted to check in, but the cell signal was weak.  Thankfully Washington didn't need cell service to pull off his extraordinary feat, but when you have great company who needs it?  One observation I had was serving warm bread with small cold packages of butter.  I'm not sure if it's a covid thing, but a plate of butter would be a nice touch and more fitting for a beautifully decorated place.\n\nI would repeat, the service here (except the cell) was exceptional.","stars":5}

While the dining area is clean and comfortable, and the service good (not great), the food, while authentic Mexican fare is only fair and the time the kitchen takes to serve up the food is unacceptably long (really long), and the execution is spotty. \n\nThe tamales were very good; generously sized and plenty of chicken. But unfortunately they were cold in the center. The beef in the Mexican steak (Bistec Mexicano) was very fatty and tough and the salsa hot but not much else (like flavor). The fish (piscado frito) was just okay, not a lot of flavor.  There seems to be only one homemade salsa (a red salsa), and otherwise they supply bottled Valentino taco\/hot sauce. It would be nice if they offered more variety of salsas-or at least a salsa verde. \n\nWhile I was hoping that El Burrito would offer an alternative to El Primo in Norristown, alas not.

We mixed the happy hour menu with the regular one, so we got the bop burger, KFC wings, chop salad, Korean nachos (different from the one on the menu), and ginger mules. \n\nThe ginger mule is VERY strong. It may be straight up whiskey (some people may like that LOL). I liked the bop burger, and it comes with spicy fries. If you order the wings, please keep in mind that you will only get 4 or 5, and they may look spicy, but they are not. If you come for happy hour, I would recommend ordering the wings. The Korean nachos off the happy hour money is large enough for 2-3 people. We enjoyed it and actually were unable to finish it because it was so large. \n\nOne thing my friend and I kept talking about is the bibimbap is overpriced. You can get it for so much cheaper at other restaurants. \n\nThe service improved as we ate. The restaurant is still learning, assuming it was one of its first happy hours. We had a parking meter to tend to, but we ended up having to ask three different servers for our bill. The restaurant recently opened so it looks clean and modern--definitely a place people would want to hang out at during happy hour.

Well because the owners are the sweetest humans, their barista humans are equally as amazing. Not to mention the pride Ryan takes in roasting his beans. Their coffee is amazing and rich as coffee should be. You can taste the notes in the bean because they are that good. Coffee not your jam? Try one of their teas or their seasonal drinks because they don't disappoint. And can I say holy ambiance. I'm reluctant to even talk about how great it is because I don't want to share. That's right I'm selfish and don't want to share my spot. Loved that they added a small food menu to accompany their delightful pastry selection. Oh and they always always always make the drinks for my kids at the perfect temp. I no longer have to hang my head in shame and sheepishly ask the barista to remake the drink for my assertive 4 year old (what can I say she likes what she likes). \n\nWhat I order:\nBreve latte -- yes I like real thick cream in my latte, iced depending on the season for all us basics. This legit tastes like a milkshake. It's beautiful. It's chocolate-y. It's delightful. \n\nAvo toast -- millennial staple of course. Theirs doesn't disappoint. The bread is not that hard stuff you get (looking at you Sabrina's).

{"region":"EAST","text":"We hired The Bathroom Boyz, AKA, Gregory G's Construction (owned by Greg Gillespie) to completely remodel our only Levittowner bathroom.  Greg said it would take \"about a week.\"  After shopping for tile, vanity, lights, etc., he increased the price by $1,000.  They demolished the bathroom in one day and we were told that night that additional plumbing work needed to be done before going further.  My husband and myself were each told a different reason for the extra $750 in plumbing.  After the second payment of three, work went extremely slow.  Here are some of the many problems that occurred during the next 3 weeks:\n* Floor tile was put in without leveling and the grout was done improperly.\n* Two of the four walls are not square and are slanted; one being in the tub area.\n* Wall tiles are uneven, spaces between uneven, some cracked and crooked, and grout was done improperly and has many different colors of gray with cracks and holes.  Wall tile also has grout on the tile in many areas.  In a corner, the wall tile is pushed into the wall.\n* There is caulk in some of the grout areas instead of grout.\n* Medicine cabinet was not sealed and has open air coming out on the top.\n* They dropped tile into the toilet flange which ended up causing a clog and water to come out of the bottom of the toilet.  We had to hire a plumber and the toilet had to be snaked and reseated.\n* The light over the medicine cabinet was placed about 5 inches too high & is almost touching the ceiling.\n* The tub faucet was not secured properly and needs to be held down to turn the shower on and at one point caused the water to not run.\n* Greg never made a diagram as to how the subway (wall) tile was supposed to be placed and we had to work on the spot with the workers who came.  \n* Vanity was supposed to be painted and it was never painted or installed.\n* We agreed on crown molding around the ceiling and Greg never took that into consideration and the wall tile was placed up to the ceiling.  This created a gap where the tile started from the wall that was not tiled.\n* The spackling was never finished nor done correctly, and the painting was never completed.  \n* By the fourth Monday, Greg argued with us and ultimately agreed the job was \"unprofessional.\" He agreed to come back and redo the tile and finish the rest of the work, but never came back nor contacted us.\n\nSeveral contractors have advised us that our bathroom has to be completely redone.  At least one of these contractors has also stated that they have redone numerous bathrooms that were originally done by The Bathroom Boyz.  Please think hard before hiring The Bathroom Boyz, AKA, Gregory G's Construction.","stars":1}

{"region":"EAST","text":"This review is overdue, so here I am waiting for breakfast seems like a good time to play catch up! \n\nI teach yoga and have a meditation practice so floating seemed like a good thing to try. Sensory deprivation, to be devoid of sound, taste, touch, smell and sight. Floating in space almost is the idea.\n\nYou book in advance and have your own private room. This is good compared to tanks I have seen that look like coffins! This is more of a spa feel. When you walk in the atmosphere is comfortable and serene where a friendly staff greets you and preps you for a tour.\n\nThe rooms have different themes and are equipped with a personal shower and a pool for one. Once you go in you shower to make sure you have no products on you including make up or hair stuff. The pool is filled with one ton of Epsom salt which leaves you weightless in the water. They have a cool light inside along with soothing music which I think is great for beginners. Complete silence and quiet could feel overwhelming and scary at first until you have more trust for the process. Anyway, you have the option to turn that stuff off and on at any time. Then what? That's it. You float. Give your body the experience of complete relaxation as the water supports you. No effort required from any part of your body, and you have the ability to truly let go.\n\nPersonally even with having a meditation practice it was still difficult to stay present. I got out a little early and I'm sure it takes getting used to. Once you are finished they have a room where you can sit and decompress, have tea and journal in a community book. Really liked that.\n\nI give four stars only because I didn't like the room I was in. The Galaxy room was painted black which made me a little anxious about what I couldn't see in terms of cleanliness. The other rooms I would prefer like the world room has more of a spa feel.","stars":4}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Whoa!  Is my take on this new Northern Liberties Vietnamese place vastly different from the critics' reviews?!!  Perhaps the critics liked the story of the owner's personal history of living in Vietnam which is very interesting ... but does it translate to a quality food experience.  Let me look at two items on the menu that I recently ordered when I stopped by to try Same Same out.  The famous Vietnamese Chicken Salad (Goi Ga Tuoi)  is on the menu but was I very disappointed in this offering - especially after having enjoyed wonderful renditions of this dish at a couple of other Vietnamese restaurants in Philly.  Here it was more like \"salad with chicken\" instead of \"chicken salad\" as it consisted mostly of shaved cabbage.  I could count the small chicken slivers on my fingers.  There were several very tiny peanut nuggets (or whatever they are called) that wound up at the bottom of the salad.  With a little fish sauce, the salad was pleasant enough for a side salad but hardly worth 9 dollars.  Then there was the Homemade Lime Shake.  This was a well-made drink but over half of my glass was ice cubes.  Is this authentic Vietnamese as this restaurant claims to be with over half of the drink filled up with ice cubes??  I didn't drink anything with ice when I was in Vietnam (for health safety reasons) but I don't remember seeing any Vietnamese street merchants loading their drinks with an over abundance of ice.  \nAnyway, the service was friendly, the hot chilies they gave me to spice up the chicken salad were awesome hot...but that was it for me.  I'll leave this place to the critics and to all the other people who are finding Same Same a good addition to the Philly culinary scene.. My summary - \"More chicken, less ice!\"","stars":2}

Yes, we walked in 10 minutes prior to closing but judging by our treatment, you'd think we just robbed them of their material riches and stole their first borns!   I almost felt like apologizing ... for something...anything....just to make them feel better.    Ugh, just writing about it is annoying but I won't let three BAD attitudes soil the hotel's rating.\n\nTo Hilton:  please get rid of your unhappy staff or hide them behind the scenes, away from public interaction.  Folks in public areas need very specific skill sets and personality traits.  These three employees should be working at a motel on the corner not a $300\/night hotel.","stars":4}
{"region":"EAST","text":"Wow! Probably some of the best pizza I've ever had in the area. And what a great location off of Kelly Drive. I came with a group of five and we sat outside and did a family style dinner and ordered a number of the things off the menu. \n\nNot a single thing we ordered was a disappointment. Whipped Ricotta, Mommy's Meatballs, Charred Octopus (wasn't adventurous enough to try this but the others raved about it), Sausage and Peppers Pizza and the Pepperoni Pizza.\n\nIn Riva is a great place to take anyone. Very versatile in its relaxed yet classy atmosphere. Can't wait to come again.","stars":5}
{"region":"EAST","text":"Tony Luke's deserves its spot on the Must Have Cheesesteak List, but the money maker is the pork sandwich w\/prov.  I think the bread is great, which is also dipped in au  jus. Don't want it for fear of soggy bread? Ask without (which is probably a good call if you're not going to eat it on the spot). My favorite combo so far is cheesesteak w\/prov, fried onions, rabe, and mushrooms. \n\nThe GM is making a big effort to make sure customers are happy, which makes sense seeing that there are some surprisingly negative reviews on Yelp. He gave us a sample of the marinara sauce and we happily dunked just about everything in it.","stars":5}
{"region":"EAST","text":"The Brisket was dry. The Smoked ribeye had no smoke flavor and was well done (as in overcooked). The sausage was just ok, the pulled chicken was ok. The Mac and Cheese was good. The collard greens were soupy. There was no brisket or meat or meat flavor to them, and they had lots of tomatoes in them. Tomatoes?","stars":2}

Anyone who is gluten free can eat almost everything here. Very relaxing, comfortable atmosphere.","stars":5}

There's an organic store, an antique shop, and a crossfit place in the back. Owowcow is next to the organic store. \n\nI had a cookies and cream milkshake. Milkshakes come in two sizes. The large is only $1 more so of course I had to go with that. It was big and creamy. The service was average, and it wasn't crowded on a late summer Saturday during the day \n\nI think it would be neat if they had wider straws for the milkshakes with pieces in them like chocolate chip, cookies and cream, etc.","stars":4}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Had a bizarre experience here when my boss sent me to return the chicken he'd ordered for lunch, complaining that it didn't appear fully cooked.  All I wanted was a refund, not an argument, but the chef came out from the kitchen with a raw chicken breast to show me \"what raw chicken looks like\" and cut it open on the front counter, where the money is handled, with no plate or gloves, and shoved the raw slice in my face.... The act itself seemed aggressive to me, and he and the female manager were both rude in their tone.  I work for a small business and try to support them whenever I can but the attitude of the staff at Wishbone is atrocious and I would never come back.\n\nEdit:  You all can read the tone of the owner comment below and judge for yourself whether this is a place you'd like to support with your money.\n\nSecond and final edit:  I received a harassing Yelp private message from Erica H. of this business, who called me a \"LIAR\" (all caps), \"stupid,\" and said I was filled with \"inner filth.\"  I just can't even. This place is beyond surreal. I am more than happy to send the screenshot to anyone who wants to see it.","stars":1}
{"region":"EAST","text":"Andrew photographed our wedding in September in Vermont and I can honestly say he well surpassed my expectations. Everything we communicated about the style we were going for, what kind of photos we hoped to have, he nailed. We now have a huge selection of beautiful photos that captured our joy on that day, the spirit of our event and how much fun all our guests had.  I'm so impressed with the lighting of the darker evening photos at the reception which turned out amazing as well as the natural outdoor ones. He found a way to capture so many things happening throughout the day and night while being unobtrusive. From our first contact with Andrew, he was always professional, clear about his rates, what to expect and what he needed from us. He is such a friendly and fun person and instantly made us feel comfortable for our engagement shoot which was included in the price. And we very much appreciated his reasonable prices and felt like it was worth every penny. He was also willing to come to NYC where we live for the engagement shoot and travel to Vermont for the event which was a bonus. I can't say enough great things about Andrew and his services so don't miss out! Working with him was one of the best decisions we made for our wedding.","stars":5}

{"region":"EAST","text":"Update: They've added acoustic tiles to the ceiling and drapes to the windows! They continue to personalize the space with great art, too. A warm scone with hot coffee has hit the spot. Kudos!  (end update) I agree with Chef L. The space is pretty but uncomfortably loud. The 'yell your name' food delivery system only adds to the din. As a local hot spot, it's super busy and family friendly. I don't mind paying for good quality food and the espresso has improved. The owners and workers are friendly. The space could benefit from soundproofing and table numbers.","stars":5}

{"region":"EAST","text":"I came here after a morning yoga class with a friend. Funny thing was I was prepared with cash on me that particular day, and sure enough this place was cash only. No ATM fees for me.\n\nI had the french toast. The texture was crispy and not moist, but I have to say I liked it. There was a lot of cinnamon on it. The meal, the Lot, came with cheese eggs and 2 slices of bacon. The bacon was thin but crispy and good. I was still a bit hungry afterward, so we shared tater tots sprinkled with old bay.\n\nI enjoyed the intimate setting and would come here again. Nothing really blew me away, but I also wasn't dissatisfied with my meal. It would be a cute place to meet up.","stars":4}

{"region":"EAST","text":"We had a great experience with JAM Catering in July 2014. JAM is the exclusive caterer at a number of venues in the Philadelphia area, and when you go with one of those, you get a JAM wedding planner that helps you organize the whole day -- not just the food.  We were given a tour of the Swedish Museum by JAM planner Mandy L., and while we loved her immediately, we wanted a more nature-y venue. We ended up going with the Audubon Center, another JAM venue, and JAM assigned Mandy to work with us even though it wasn't her usual venue. She was absolutely wonderful from start to finish, helping us customize our menu to both our taste and budget, and she helped make sure the whole day went smoothly -- helping to set up our decorations, coordinate with vendors, etc. The food from both the cocktail hour and the reception earned rave reviews from the guests. Everything was perfect and we couldn't have dreamed of a better day! I highly recommend JAM.","stars":5}

They have a big sign apologizing for slow service due to under staffing but our service was decent and friendly.  Good for lunch & happy hour.","stars":3}
{"region":"EAST","text":"I'd only come here for their $3 on the third day of the month deal, so it was a steal for how much food I got. The lines were out the door, but usually when I pass it it's pretty empty since it just opened.\n\nI decided to try this place after a friend recommended it to me and ate his sandwich in front of me, which smelled amazing. \n\nWhen I actually ordered my food however, the sandwiches are packed with a LOT of meat-- great for some, but a taste would have been enough for me--I wanted more vegetables to round out the taste! Probably great sandwiches if you're super into southern BBQ, but I would not eat one by itself for lunch--too greasy, needed to drink a lot of water and eat carrots afterwards. \n\nThey were giving out small bottles of Sriracha though (I didn't get one...), which was nice of them. Seems like they are trying to really promote their business,  since the location is a bit out of the way and a normal sandwich is $8-$11, which is a bit pricey.","stars":3}
