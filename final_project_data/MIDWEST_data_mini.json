I ordered the blood orange margarita and she had the strawberry - both were pretty good but not particularly memorable. We ordered chips, elote queso and salsa verde. The chips had the perfect amount of salt and were crunchy but flaky at the same time which I liked. The server was attentive. The space was pretty empty for a Saturday evening at 5:30, but that meant we didn't have to wait. Overall pleasant experience! I plan on returning for tacos sometime soon.","stars":4}

A friend and I arrived at 9 am for our appointments.  I  could write a novel, but I'll boil it down to this.  There was one worker there who told me the man doing my nails was stuck in traffic.  She started in my friend's manicure while I sat unattended for 45 minutes.  She never apologized or offered an explanation.  When I said something after over 30 minutes, she said she didn't own it, she just worked there and has no control over anyone else.  Then she said it was the other nail tech's day off, so someone would be coming at some point.  When the nail tech arrived, no apology.  The woman doing my friend's nails said the other people didn't speak English so she doesn't know why they were late and again isn't the owner and is just a worker.  I ended up leaving after 45 minutes because I had to catch a flight.  My friend had a manicure where the woman doing her nails didn't speak one word to her, never used any lotion on her hands and walked away when it was done.  We weren't offered anything to drink and treated hor\nI emailed the owner twice and was never contacted.

When we saw the crowded courtyard\/patio of Neveria La Vallesana, we knew where to stop. \nThe patio was full of a good mix of people; young and old, many nationalities, and everyone seemed to be in a good mood. I was a little apprehensive of the neighborhood but things were friendly. We felt safe and secure the whole meal through. \nThe menu is straight forward and easy to read. Written in both English and Spanish, a strong variety of tacos, tortas, quesadillas, and burritos are offered. \nI tried a tongue taco for the first time (Taste similar to roast beef). Two chirizo tacos for the price of one. A seasoned chicken burrito with nachos as the entree. Wife had two shredded beef tacos and a a seasoned chicken quesadilla. The quesadilla had re-fried beans in it, it wasn't bad we just weren't expecting the taste. \nThe tacos are served with corn tortillas and there is no cheese as they are served. But you can ask for it as an up charge. \nThe table was set with a spicy red salsa, mild green salsa, and cleaned peeled radishes- no chips. \nThe joint serves Mexican Coke, but you have to ask for it specifically. The regular Cokes are served in glass bottles! \nRecap: \n5 tacos \n1seasoned chicken quesadilla \n1 chicken burrito \n2 glass bottle Cokes \nTotal- $23 & change. I'll go back.","stars":3}

It wasn't packed, people were having a good time, talking, laughing, playing games, and drinking. I ended up ordering meatballs which was okay due to the fact it was mainly covered in BBQ sauce, and the meatballs were small. Miracle On South was a seasonal Christmas bar that stayed open until Christmas Eve at 9pm. I'm glad the weather for Christmas Eve wasn't too bad. Also, my Jingle Balls Nog was just okay tasted kinda of water down, I didn't taste egg nog, and barely the alcohol.

I'm for sure a meatitarian, but it's not necessary to add chicken to the Pasta Con Broccoli, even though you can. I'm surprised this is my opinion and I kind of want to smack myself for feeling that way, but this menu item is perfect as is.

How would I feel about Cafe Nonna's recipe?\n\nI'm happy to report that Cafe Nonna has whipped up something typical of what one would find in a European gelateria.  My mascarpone was quite lovely, flashing me back to the days when one could always find me with a sugar cone of slow-melting gelato in one hand and a map in another.

Hazelnut was a cookie with basically Nutella on it. Sugar Cookie was fine. \n\nI'm happy we weren't the ones to actually pay for these.

Between our committed relationship with Late Harvest and the great Yelp reviews, we were really excited to finally make it to North End. Sadly, it was one of the worst dining experiences my husband and I have had.  The food was ok, not really what we had expected in terms of taste of the sauces. We thought the bbq options were very very sweet, and this former Virginian can tell you that the Carolina-style bbq sauce is not on par with the Carolina style I've had in the past. However, the sides were good and I was more than happy to enjoy the Late Harvest fries, which are a holy experience. My cocktail was also absolutely stellar. \nBut it really fell apart with the service, which is a shame because that's one of the most consistently great qualities of Late Harvest. North End would typically be a rather fast dining experience, and we could tell that by how speedy the food arrived to the tables around us. However, at the tables around us we had an entire rotation of of guests be sat, served and paid, by the time our food arrived. We waited close to an hour with not sign of our server and no refills, which we gladly would have taken at that point. Our server got so provoked when we asked if our dinner was en route that she simply shouted, \"Yep!\" and didn't come back until we were almost done to asked if we wanted another drink! It was just so bizarre. We didn't want refills and surely didn't want dessert after that. \nNext date night, we'll head back to our first love, Late Harvest Kitchen, where we can dine for nearly the same cost as our brisket and pulled pork and have exponentially better service.","stars":1}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"John,\n     I really don't know where else to turn.  Ken Ray Bailey told me that he uses your shop to work on cars.  He picked up my truck on April 10th for a full rebuild.  The problem was that it was leaking from the connector, and i figured that a full rebuild was worth it if it had to be pulled to fix the leak.  I told him that the original shop i took it to said that the valve body was the problem.  He brought it back a week later, still leaking with black silicone everywhere.  I called him and he said he would take it back clean off the silicone and fix the leak with a new wiring harness.  After another week, and him giving me the run around, I had had enough and asked where my car was because I wanted to pick it up.  He had my 1200 dollars, and my car.  He would never give me an address.  He told me i had to meet him at your shop after hours.  I told him that was unacceptable, and wanted my car immediately.  Then he agreed to meet at your shop at 2 o'clock. I was on the phone with him and he said he would bring it to my work, after i gave him the address, and waited over 2 hours, he said \"ill be there in 5 minutes\". I waited outside my work for 20 more minutes.  Then he texted that he dropped the car off at my mothers house, the original place he picked up the car the first time.  I asked repeatedly for the receipts for the parts, he said he would fax them over, and never did.  Was he working on a white avalanche, or a older blue van with Illinois tags for you? Because those are the cars he and his wife drove around when picking up and dropping of my truck.  My problem is now i have a car that leaks so bad there is a 8 foot puddle under it, and I'm out $1200.  Its not even drive able now.  I have no proof that Ken did anything to my car except smoke a lot of cigarettes in it and smear black silicone to try to stop it from leaking, and somehow made it leak worse than before.  This man lied to me numerous times, I have all of the text messages that we sent back and forth, and would be happy to show them to you.  He says now the leak is a separate issue, and I need to buy more parts, even though the only reason he was working on it was because it was leaking.  If I can't get any thing out of Ken, I guess I will have talk to everybody i can just to make sure he doesn't do this to other people.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Probably my best food truck experience to date.  Ordered the cuban sandwich and was met with the seemingly ubiquitous, \"fries?\"  Knowing I'm in food truck land and upsells for sides can add $5-7 to my bill, I politely said no thanks.\n  I did ask for extra pickles on the sandwich and heard the lady at the window say mucho something which started a bit of an argument in the truck.  I going to guess the sandwiches are prepped ahead with little ability to alter.(Especially since mine seemed standard after recieving) Figuring my sandwich probably wouldnt be enough I also ordered 2 beef empanadas.\n\nOrder was prepared quickly, maybe 5 minutes.  When I opened my bag, it had fries.  Apparently, the sandwich comes with a side item and my worry of an upsell was only an assumption I wanted fries.    Now Im curious what other sides the have available.\n\nThis was all to-go btw.  When I got home sandwich (missing extra pickles) was larger than expected.  Too often food truck portions are on the small side.  This was easily good for 2 people.  Fries, nice unexpected bonus, and the beef empanadas were really, really good.  Even after 1 shot grease all over my leg.  My fault for not eating at the table.  Had this not been 15 minutes after getting my food, it would have been hot, and yes it could have ruined clothing.  But I strangely without a napkin near I found myself licking it off in beefy greasy bliss.\n\nLooking forward to the other half sandwich tonight AND the next opportunity I have to order from this truck.  Keep up the good work.","stars":5}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"After hearing a lot of buzz about this place, I finally got to try it out tonight.  I was initially disappointed as they ran out of the catfish po boy, so I opted for the sausage po boy, which was AMAZING.  It had a balanced amount of fatty juice oozing out with each bite, and the soft french bread, cajun mayo\/sauce concoction, and the coleslaw made it the perfect package.  5 stars for the sandwich alone. \n\nWe dined in and ordered all the side dishes except for cornbread.  You MUST get the creole, garlic stew, and coleslaw.  I'm not a big fan of coleslaw, but Papa Roux's is the BEST I've ever had.  The veggies were so crisp and fresh, and I loved how it was more vinegar-based and very light on the mayo.  \n\nPretty good: Etouffee (personally, I like Yat's better - I just prefer it a chunkier\/thicker texture), red beans, and bread pudding. \n\nWorth passing up: Applesauce.  It's obviously canned.  I thought it might've been homemade when I ordered it, but hey, you can't win them all. \n\nI also think the place needs better lighting, and the decor needs to be spruced up.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy divey establishments, but Papa Roux had a slight grungy appearance.  However, the food is fantastic and you get a lot of bang for your buck, so it won't deter me from returning.  I hope to try the catfish next time!","stars":4}

Right from the start the server seemed to be in a bad mood, yet took our orders in a timely manner.  The rolls weren't anything special, the potato soup was good but served at room temperature, the potato skin appetizer was good but very very greasy, then we were served our main entrees.  My steak was extremely fatty, tough, chewy, and over-cooked.  My mashed potatoes were cold and served with brown water (gravy).  The ribs were decent though.  My wife's steak was served in a pool of blood, she had ordered it medium.  Neither of us could finish even half our steaks as they were just terrible cuts of beef.  Back to the server; without asking if we would like desert she laid the check on the table and asked if we needed to-go boxes (we hardly started eating our entrees at the time).  We felt as though she was rushing us out.  When we complained about our food, she just started blaming the cooks and complained how business was too slow and they were cutting down on servers, etc.  It also made me uncomfortable that the server stood over me as I was contemplating the tip amount, very rude.  So we won't be going back.  One star for low-quality food and annoying service.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"There is a beautiful little shop on the south end of old town Zionsville that displays the art of (and is operated by) 24 artists, including local talent.  The art covers a wide range of mediums including paintings (all kinds), ceramics, fused glass, woodcraft, stained glass, jewelry, and textiles.  And the quality is amazing.  Sure, the prices will probably be higher than the mass produced stuff you find at the big box stores, but the quality is worth the price and in most cases, the pieces are hand made (there are some smaller prints of paintings in the $10-25 range).\n\nThe arrangements are done tastefully allowing each artist to display their works in a manner that you can quickly see what appeals to you.  With up to 24 artists contributing, you may want to allow some time to browse before picking anything up.  My wife was particularly interested in the fused glass of artist Deb Achgill and the ceramics of Chris Davis.  I liked the unique wood carvings of Bob Anderson and the numerous paintings throughout.\n\nWhat ever your interest in art, you can find something here that is priced so that you may be able to leave with it.

The chicken appeared to have been grilled and the dropped on top of the pasta, but it was seriously overcooked and almost inedible. My husband ordered the pork tenderloin duo. The concept was that the fried tenderloin would be placed in two buns instead of on due to its immense size. However, that was not the case.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Bar Food circa 1992 plus the usual beer suspects you'd expect from an Irish themed bar.  Other than the beer, there's nothing much here I would associate with Ireland, especially, but it is a good neighborhood watering hole.\n\nWe do really like the big outside area, especially on a day like this past Saturday, when it was maybe 80 degrees and sunny.   There were a couple of bigger parties hanging out and having a few beers - definitely a recommended way to enjoy Seamus McDaniel's.  By the time we left, at 2 or so, there were quite a few tables occupied inside.   \n\nWe had a burger with Provel (not the cheese we'd usually select, but with the burger being a little overcooked, this was a good choice).  We also had a grilled Buffalo chicken sandwich.  Also fine.  The onion rings are of the mega thick variety and were good.\n\nThe ambience?  Same as twelve years ago - same tables, chairs, gum I put under one of the tables...nothing has changed and they don't seem eager to evolve.   Sometimes that's okay, but this time it kind of made me wish we would have tried something a little more interesting.  If you've never been, and you like good bar food, want a couple of cold beers or  a big burger. definitely stop by.   \n\nIf we come back in the next five years, it will be due to the convenience to Forest Park or because we want outside seating and we're oretty sure there will be a table.  Definintely not because we want to try something new. \n\nOne more thing: I never really put gum under a table here, but if I did, it would still be there..","stars":3}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"You want to eat here. Trust me. \n\nWinslow's Home was on my list of places to try before I moved. I had heard nothing but great things and it sounded like a type of place I would enjoy. It's part restaurant, part general store (with nothing but the coolest gifts) and part bakery. My type of place. They have a cute little outdoor seating area in the front, the street is kind of noisy but I wasn't bothered by it. The inside is warm and inviting and someplace you just want to hang out. \n\nMy friend and I were waiting in line, and of course the line was right in front of the pastry shelf. So we did what any rational adult would do and ordered every pastry we decided we wanted. I think we ended up with 12 or so different items. We couldn't eat just pastries for a late breakfast so we also ordered food; I had the corn beef hash and a chai latte, and I don't remember what he got (so sorry, it's been a while). While we waited for our food we sat outside and ate bites of each of the pastry. The s'mores tart was just a bit rich, the pumpkin muffin pair perfectly with my chai, the lemon square was perfectly tart and sweet, the brownie was delectable and I don't remember the rest of what we had, but there was very little left by the time our food came out. The meals were just as good. My hash was heavenly and he at all of his food as well. \n\nAfter eating we wondered around looking at all the cool little trinkets on sale and if I were not on a strict budget at the time I would have bought all the spices and maybe a few candles too. \n\nWinslow's Home is wonderful. Overall it reminds me of a general store in a small town; it's kind of nice to forget that you're in a big city every now and then.","stars":5}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I've been to the Egyptian Room around 10 times in the last 8 years or so to see a variety of different concerts and shows. I was recently there at the end of March to see the comedian Bo Burnham. For a concert the place is fairly typical for your indoor venue. People are standing shoulder to shoulder as you get closer to the stage. For most shows, they do have tables set up in the back on a first come first serve basis (during general admission shows). There are plenty of places set up to buy drinks, however, I can't comment on them as they are expensive and not worth running to the restroom for me. Speaking of the restroom, there is only one nearby for the entire crowd. If it is a sold out show, get ready to wait in a long line (male or female). \n\nOn to the shows themselves: I've never had an issue with acoustics, whether it be a concert or a comedian. I've stood in numerous places through the room and never had a problem hearing the act. For assigned seating, like we had for Bo, they definitely cram as many seats as humanly possible into the room. If you are of the heavier set variety, you might be uncomfortable.\n\nA special note about the most recent show I attended: Every single show prior to this one I have attended, I have entered through the door along New Jersey St. However, during the Bo Burnham show they were letting people in through the door on the opposite side of the building. Well, they failed to inform the 100+ of us who were standing in line outside the wrong door. You would have thought they would have sent someone out to let us know, especially since we didn't realize our mistake until 20 minutes til the show was supposed to start. It wasn't a big deal since it wasn't that cold outside, but still annoying. Actually funny thinking back on it.\n\nI will definitely be going back to the Egyptian Room as long as they still keep bringing in great acts!","stars":4}

Chicken was a bit on the dry side but turkey was close to perfect.  Sauces are very good, especially the mustard-based one.  We moved quickly through the line and without being asked, the staff helped me with my to-go order (had a kid in my arms).  They also came out to offer her a shake that they had made but hadn't used, which made her happy.  Carolina doesn't come with a side, and the sides are around $2.50 each, which added up quickly (note the price of the corn muffins as a side should be reconsidered).

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Just wanted to share an amazing experienced my husband and I had Tuesday (12\/5\/17). Our server, Sarah, went above and beyond with providing excellent service. \n\nPreviously, I had a horrible experience at Bonefish in May of 2017. My waitress, Cambria, was rude and seemed extremely unknowledgeable about the menu. She couldn't answer basic questions regarding ingredients in certain dishes. My husband has food allergies and when we asked for a list of ingredients she acted like our request was unreasonable. Cambria seemed to not be interested in waiting on us. I overheard her cursing, within ear shot, of other guests. I do not know if her cursing was regarding our request for an ingredient list so I thought it would be best to try to continue to have a good evening. Despite her poor attitude, we decided to stay and try the food. We heard good things about the bang bang shrimp and it lives up to its reputation. Had Cambria provided excellent customer service, we would have had a great evening. Unfortunately, her attitude left a sour taste in our mouths and we decided our first trip to Bonefish would be our last.\n\nFast forward to December 5, 2017. My in-laws were in town visiting. They read some positive reviews on yelp and since we were in the area, they asked if we could visit for dinner. My husband and I were hesitant, but decided to give in due to their persistence. \n\nUpon arrival, we were seated fairly quickly. Our server, Sarah, was extremely friendly. She was upbeat, polite and could easily list off ingredients in order to accommodate my husbands allergies. Her product knowledge made it extremely fast and effortless for us to order an appropriate dish. She was even knowledgeable in the wine selection. She recommend a Coppola Directors Cut that paired excellent with our meal. During, Jay stopped by our table to asked if we enjoyed our meal. I could tell he cared about customer satisfaction and that he really enjoys his job. It really did mean a lot that he'd take the time out to connect with us.\n\nBonefish has obviously changed a lot since our first visit. I am glad my husband and I decided to give them another chance. We will most definitely make more trips in the near future.","stars":5}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"So, they have a great selection, but the service is terrible. I went in to buy a bottle of port for Valentine's Day. I was the only one in the store, and there were two employees working. Neither greeted me, and heaven forbid they asked what I was searching for (very specific items, too). I had to go up to them and interrupt their chatting, as they were clearly more engrossed in their conversation than in helping a girl out. I asked about a specific port, and one woman pointed into their cooler and told me I could try in there. I was kind of surprised she didn't show me herself since they weren't exactly swamped. So, I went in and it took a while to find it as there were no labels indicating what was what. But, I found it-- for $70. \n\nAnd then I realized I could not buy from them. When I left the cooler, they never even asked if I had any luck. So, as I was leaving, I told them that they did in fact have it, but I could not possibly buy anything from them because of the poor service, smiled, and walked away. \n\nThen, I went down to Vino Villa and had a great experience. Even though it wasn't what I wanted, I decided to try out a bottle they had because they actually seemed to care about me. \n\nI can never go back to that store because I make a point to never do business with those that just don't even notice I exist. They could have had a nice sale and a good customer, as I was planning on buying several things. But instead, the search continues.","stars":1}

I've been there 20+ times in 6 months and make a point to be friendly to the owners and folks who work there.

We recently did the chef's 5-course tasting meal with wine pairings and it was excellent. We started with the shrimp corn dogs and then followed with a smoked salmon salad, foie gras, sole, venison, and then dessert course. It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. The staff there was also excellent. We had an issue with the weather and our babysitter couldn't make it, so we decided to go with our toddler in tow. Not only did the staff tell us the restaurants was kid friendly and reassure me it was no big deal for our 3 year old to be there, but they also went out of their way to make us feel comfortable having him there, including doing a magic trick for him, and Chef even talked to him and gave him some ice cream. It just helped us have such a great experience. What a wonderful place with the best food in Indy! We plan to go quarterly for a 5-course meal!","stars":5}

It was overall very good and I would definitely come back. I got a small cheesecake flavored with graham cracker mix in and it was around $6.50 which is on the more expensive side in my opinion so keep that in mind if you're coming here on a budget.

She said Value City needs more training on what the warranty covers. Which at this point is obvious because of our experience.\nI then called Value City Support, they initially gave me a run around and said they could send someone out to look at it and that we were suppose to call them before the warranty company (which is not stated anywhere, the warranty actually says opposite) and then turned around and said since we picked the furniture up that we would be charged for someone to come look at it. (Terry recommended we pick it up because we had the vehicle to do so and that it would not change anything...) VCF Support then said to contact the store. \nI called the store and spoke with Lisa, from the moment she answered she was honest, helpful, and made this experience better by providing helpful information and not trying to give me a run around.

Next, Black bugs flying around our table, and $35 for two kids meals and 1 adult-no drinks or alcohol. Not the same that I remember, and so not worth it.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I was a repeat customer to Bello for around a year every month, I have never really gotten my nails done consistently until last year, so I guess I didn't realize the quality wasn't worth the price. I normally got dip powder nails, which were around 80$ including a tip, and I got them done by a nail tech named Phung, who, in my opinion, was the best. The receptionist, Mila, was very in your face, though mostly trying to help. \n\nThe nails lasted from a range of 2 weeks-2 months (if you kept sticking the ones that had fallen off back on with nail glue.) This sort of inconsistency is obviously not the nail techs fault, but 2 weeks is not something I wanted to pay 80$ for. After those 2 weeks, they refuse to fix a broken nail or 2 because I guess that is when they claim you need a new set. \n\nThe white color dip powder turns tan\/brown after a couple days of \"being in the sun\" as they put it, it was gross looking and sad, considering I wasn't about to pay another 80$ since they wouldn't give me a new set. They did end up giving me 15% off my new set after that. \n\nThere were a couple of instances I considered not going back, but I finally chose to leave for good when I noticed the nails kept falling off closer to 2 weeks of being on.","stars":2}

The women who I assume was the manger on duty, was touching food  with no gloves. No nothing. No rings or anything. I had to honk my horn to get their attention. The same lady tells me to hold on a minute by waving a finger at me, she then puts on gloves. Continues to make her sandwich, and then comes to the window and says \"sorry the headset died\" which I knew was a load of BS. This is sad and ridiculous service. I use to come here all the time.

It wasn't horrific, though, just made me a little ill. Kinda salty too. Sean got fried chicken strips, fries, and coleslaw. Their coleslaw was pretty amazing, tho, like ALMOST as amazing as BCD.

They have a texting system for the waiting list which is a bonus. \n\nWe were a party of three - and essentially had the same opinion.  Some of the items were a home-run and others were a total miss.  The meat saved the day - we had chicken, burnt ends, trip tip and pulled pork.  Smothered fries were off the charts - But the biggest winner was the chicken.  Literally, some of the best chicken we have every had ...hands down! So moist and seasoned to perfection.  The other meats were excellent. \n\nHouse-made bbq sauces were great!  What didn't rate with us was the cornbread and the sides-  the corn bread is a heavy dense cornbread recipe, not the sweet fluffy cake style - it's served in a mini cast iron, (bonus)... ours literally had no flavor at all. We also had brussel sprouts which tasted more boiled than roasted and had too much oil on them.  Mac and cheese, again ...no flavor.  \n\nOur waitress was excellent! We will be back!

There was literally a cup of water in the big ball of aluminum foil they served it in.  I don't think I have ever tasted anything so bland.  It was very very bland.  All I could taste is the greasy after taste.  I will say that the shrimp was perfectly cooked, just not seasoned at all.  Not even salt.  Also ordered some chicken quesadilla thing.  I can see the seasoning on it, but it had no flavor.  Was very bland, and COLD!  I don't remember what this thing is but it is long thin pieces of chicken on green peppers and lettuce with some thing tortilla chips.  I know that the peppers, lettuce AND tortilla strips were refrigerated because the tortilla strips are chewy, just like they have been refrigerated and the peppers are icy cold.  Then they put cooked chicken on top so the chicken got cold.  The salsa they provided was basically pureed tomato.  No salt, no peppers, no seasoning.  Very watery and bland.  The order only took the doordasher about 20 minutes, so it isn't Doordash's fault.  I don't think I will be trying this place again.","stars":1}

For American airlines, I wish they could find peace in their bankruptcy, but...I choose to curbside check my bug bag, as the skycaps, are great folks and have endured decades of changes and getting screwed over. I choose to tip well also, I have never had almost bag . \n\nParking..the main terminal signs seem a bit weird . For the self parking in main garage, the rates will likely  go up , so off site lots offer a better deal. If I want to leave my truck under a secure roof, I pay the premium , and do the main garage, if out a few days . It's really cleaner and well lit, on the lower levels. Again, the signage could be more distinct and bold...even flying weekly , the exits from the garage , down deep, kept changing or being diverted for repairs. I assume the sign crew has never really driven in as a customer to see how it works . The overhead lighting flares the minimal painted or installed signs and I have seen visitors literally circle for 20 minutes on the red level to exit. I actually old not find the exit on two occasions, so, I just went up the down ramp..no ones really down there anyway. \n\nThe new terminal seems up and running. The bathrooms were actually clean on Friday morning. The urinals were fishing and there were no puddles or stuck toilets...so refreshing. The concourse food still is weak in the healthy eating options. I realize the concession folks never fly anywhere or have the quality to stock carrots, fruit beyond a banana at starbucks or things like hummus. This would be a huge improvement, but the airport management and commission is essentially a dumping ground for political hacks and relatives from city hall.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"The first time I visited Punch Bowl Social, I was excited to come back. Every time since then has left me wondering why I return. I made a reservation for 15-20 people for a Saturday night at 11 p.m., just to have late night snacks and drinks for my boyfriends 30th birthday. I told the host that I would like to be close to the middle round bar, as many of us were just planning on having drinks and not eating. Making my reservation the host said she would put it down for 20, so that they could accommodate in case it was 20 people. As well, she stated it would have to be at 10:45 because that's the latest reservation her system would allow, no big deal. \nWe arrived at 10:45 and the table they sat at us was for 12 people, the host was very confused as to why I was requesting a table for 20, even though that had been confirmed previously, and it took them about 20 minutes for them to get a table to fit out group. No one came up to us while we waited for the other table. Additionally when I walked up to the host stand a server said \"I hate white people\". I think all people can be frustrating some times, but I would never make a statement like that. If I were to feel that way, which I wouldn't, I wouldn't say it at work and definitely not where others could hear my rude thoughts. The host and myself both looked surprised hearing him make his statement. \nOur server was swamped, not just with us, but with other tables, it took forever to get drinks, and food, and finally we gave up and asked for checks, this was also a long process. Honestly, every time I have been here the service was less than up to par. I wrote into their online contact us forum and never heard anything back regarding my concern, this was also frustrating.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Nothing like paying $400 to watch all your stuff get broken. I just moved yesterday with Master Movers from a one bedroom downtown to another apartment about a 10 min drive away. This was my experience:\n\n1) They originally gave me a 6 he time window of when they'd be here (between 7am and 1pm) and said they'd call the day before the move to give me a more accurate window. They didn't call, so I was ready to move at 7. I tried calling them but no one would answer. Finally at 9:10 someone called and said they'd arrive in half hr or so.\n\n2) when they arrived, they couldn't figure out how to maneuver their truck (this had not been an issue w Two Men and a Truck, which I had used earlier this year, and who had a larger truck), so they blocked a garage entrance. They wasted 20 minutes moving the truck back and forth (time I was billed for).\n\n3) I paid for two movers. What I got were three slackers. One guy was hungover and talking to his friend on his phone the whole time (except when he turned my nice wooden desk sideways and scraped it across concrete, but then leaned on it for 10 min dripping armpit sweat all over it while texting his friend)\n\n4) I lived on the 4th floor of a building w an elevator. Almost all of my stuff was packed nicely in cardboard boxes, but the entire time, it was just one guy picking up one or two boxes at a time and carrying them to the elevator. When there were maybe 4 boxes left (out of about 30), someone finally got the bright idea to use a dolly... Of course I was charged for all of that extra time it took them.\n\n5) since they blocked the garage exit, someone else in the building had to leave, so they wasted another 15 min or solving the truck away and back, which somehow was a three person job.\n\n6) instead of cooperating and carrying heavy items together (ie, one person on each end of a couch), they instead made it a competition to see who was stronger where each guy picked up either a couch or love seat on his own and tried to carry it by himself, dropping it several times on the ground and breaking the frame. \n\n7) one guy thought it would be a good idea to try to use the dolly to carry a longboard metal rod (and nothing else). Obviously it fell off a few times and got scratched.\n\n8) I had given my new address to them when I had first reserved them, so they had it in their system. When I signed all the papers, it was written down on the papers. Each one of the movers asked me multiple times where I was moving and acted like it was the first time they were hearing about it.\n\n9) all of my wine glasses were shattered\n\n10) all of my plastic stuff (drawers, laundry basket, laundry hamper) were all scraped\n\n11) their truck was muddy, so every box\/item they moved got dirty, meaning when they dragged it into my new place with brand new carpet (yes, dragged, be again, why would they use a dolly when they can just push your stuff around in the ground?) then the dirt got all over my carpet.\n\n12) they said they'd charge in 15 min increments, but they finished at 12:05 and said my end time was 12:45, and charged me for that and left.\n\n13) they didn't even assemble my queen bed (just a basic metal frame w a box spring and mattress), so I had to do it myself (and I'm a pretty small person), and injured my shoulder while trying to do that\n\n14) they were rude and complaining the entire time.\n\nBasically, I chose master movers bc the estimate was $300 (but ended up being $400) and I thought that was a better deal than two men and a truck (who charged me $600 about a year ago for the same amount of stuff), however, you really get what you pay for. Two men and a truck were awesome. I would never ever have master movers move anything again.","stars":1}

Thieves is emerging a literal beacon in this dark time with its bright neon red lights that light up the dark and refined bar. The look of the bar is very sleek and intimate, yet somewhat gives the vibe of almost an adult frat party. The music and atmosphere is very hip and trendy. \n\nWith a strong social media presence and even stronger drinks, Thieves is starting off on the right foot. Their social media advertises a variety of fun and unique specials that are branded to a young adult audience such as today's post of Tinder Tuesday where if you bring in a match they will pick up your third drink. These fun and quirky branding initiatives combined with their imaginative and fun cocktails make for a fun and interesting date and night out scene.","stars":5}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"There's not much more I can add based off other reviews so I won't go into super detail. Simply reiterating the high praise.\n\nFor food we shared the green beans, cabbage salad, shrimp toast, isaan hamachi, and short rib curry. Everything was incredible. The flavors were so dynamic and explosive. People aren't joking about that hamachi. Whatever that wonderful sauce\/broth the fish was sitting in has to be one of the best things I've ever tasted. We finished off with some wagyu and uni nigiri. I cannot believe how delicious that wagyu is. It's literally like butter. Uni is one of my favorite foods and that was the perfect little bite to finish off an unforgettable meal. I definitely hope to try the omakase one day.\nIt's not cheap, but completely reasonable in my opinion. All of this food we got plus two cocktails ended up around $160. You don't have to break the bank to have a nice meal here though.\n\nIndo absolutely deserves the hype and rave reviews it has received since opening. This is a special place and such a treat to add to an already eclectic food scene St. Louis has to offer. I'm excited to see what Nick Bognar has to offer in the future.","stars":5}

It's tasty, and properly seasoned. It was not bland at all, like some other people mentioned. The food was not the problem here at all, it was everything else.\n\nEverything else? Yes, like the fact that when the hostess seated us, she only gave us one set of silverware. There were two of us. Then our server brought us another set, but then looked at the silverware in her hand and muttered, \"Oh, this is dirty ... let me get you another one.\" Ok.

We give her a gift card and a credit card for anything remaining that the gift card doesn't cover, plus the tip. She brings back our bill for us to sign, but it shows that they didn't use $10 of the gift card, and instead charged that $10 to our credit card, and they kept our gift card with the $10 on it. We were like, \"Um? Why did you not use the entire amount of the gift card?\" Management gets involved because the server doesn't know why. Management said it's because of some policy with the gift card that states they can only charge a certain percentage of the amount on the card. So the next logical question to the server is: \"OK, so ... where is our gift card with the rest of the money on it?\" Then everyone is like, \"Oh! You wanted the gift card back?!

Dinner for 3 at a \"work-a-raunt\" shouldn't cost $60. If you want to charge those prices (and request gratuities) you should really be offering table service and you shouldn't be serving entrees on plastic trays. \n\nGinger cookie was amazing!  I would certainly swing by for another one of I found myself in the neighborhood. \n\nMushroom potstickers had a strange and unexpected taste that nobody at the table really enjoyed. \n\nOther reflections...saut\u00e9ed shrimp plate with glass noodles is tasty but a little short on the shrimp.

I get a few of these to go every time and toast them in a pan for a satisfying breakfast\n- fish fillets in hot chili oil: staple sichuan dish, and they get the flavor right with a good balance of spicy and numbing.  Be careful as it is one of the spicier dishes I have had living in Indianapolis.  A huge serving with tons of fish and cabbage to enjoy with rice!\n- cold noodle salad: addictive cold sesame noodles with a strong garlic kick and refreshing cucumber\n- duck wings: so savory.  They are a bit of an acquired taste as there is very little meat and you are mostly eating the skin.  But so so so tasty; the flavor is spot on.  Any of their cold stewed dishes will have a similar flavor profile so I suggest you try those out\n- soy milk: fresh soy milk.  If you've only had the American packaged stuff give this a try with a little sugar- it is completely different.  Soooo good.\n\nSkips:\n- Chinese cruller: I don't think these are freshly fried so they feel too oily\n- Sichuan chicken: not sure how authentic this is, but it was too sweet for me\n- steamed buns: nothing wrong with these but just as a warning the are given to you cold so you will have to heat them up yourself\n\nI keep trying to work my way through the menu but find that I keep ordering the same delicious things over and over.

Hopefully that will help you understand how incredibly disappointed I was with the food here. Being from New Orleans and spending my whole life in the gulf coast region I think this was the worst response really representation of what I consider the best food the world has to offer. I had the Ragin Cajun plate which comes with andouille sausage, red beans and rice, fried catfish and cornbread.\n1. Andouille Sausage - this was the only thing on the plate besides the cornbread that was good although it tasted like smoked sausage instead of andouille.\n2. Red beans - the chef basically took a Ferrari and tried to make it better by putting a Honda motor in it. These were the worst beans I have ever eaten. First of all the \"gravy\" was made with a tomatoe paste and actually had chunks of tomatoe in it. Red beans do not have tomatoes or paste in them. It tasted more like jambalaya than my beloved red beans. Red bean \"gravy\" is made by slow cooking the beans over hours till they break down and make a thick \"gravy\". Also red beans should be cooked with ham hocks or sausage in them which give them a lot of their flavor.\n3. Catfish - again worst I have had. Instead of filets or even nuggets they were long and skinny like octopus tentacles and just as slimy and fishy. I ate half of one and was sick to my stomach the next few hours.\nAs an appetizer I had the fried alligator. They were ok but several nuggets were rank tasting and one had the consistency of a tendon, not the pure white meat of an alligator.\nAnd last but not least my wife had to send her tuna back because instead of being rare like she asked for it was well done.\nAfter relaying our displeasure the waitress never offered anything to help the situation much less a free glass of water.\nHorrible food.","stars":1}

There were two buildings, one with miniature train sets, and another with really old and unique cars. Behind those builds were trains, trains, and trains. Oh wait, did I mention, there were trains? There are so many! And you can even climb in them! So cool! I also loved that the trains were outdoors, a good chance for the kids to get out some energy and be able to enjoy the good weather.

It was a lively scene though the acoustics in the bar is poor. We could hardly hear each other speak it was so loud. We sat at a bar table and ordered drinks & dinner.\n\nI had the \"Trip to Jalisco\" tequila cocktail. Frankly, I didn't like it. It had an odd after taste like something was stale (possibly in the simple syrup). I almost sent it back but it was so busy, I chose to just drink it.  The Chicken apple harvest salad was delicious. It was a large portion with 1 full grilled chicken breast. My friend had a beer on tap with the oyster chowder and brussels sprouts. She really enjoyed her meal.\n\nOverall I liked the vibe at Louie's and the food was good. So, we plan on returning.","stars":3}

That shit cray!), and I'm hungry. No, I'm HANGRY. I need food. Now. \n\nI was craving something protein filled, filling, and salty. Mmmm...MSG. I don't know if King Doh uses MSG or not, but for the sake of my story, let's just pretend that they do, okay? \n\nSo...where was I? Right. MSG. I needed it.\n\nKing Doh has been on my radar for quite some time, and Chinese food sounded amazing, so I went for it. I gave them a call and placed an order for my go-to dish: boneless hot braised chicken. \n\nThe friendly woman on the line asked me if it was for carryout or delivery. Woah, they deliver now? This must be a new thing, because previous Yelp reviews said they didn't. However, I wasn't feeling lazy on this particular night, so I opted to pick it up.\n\nBy the time I arrived (about 10 minutes later), my order was ready. I resisted the urge to rip open the box and gobble it down in my car, and instead drove home so I could enjoy it there. \n\nSo...how was it? It was pretty good! The white rice was fluffy and delicious, and the hot braised chicken was pretty amazing, too. They were REALLY generous with the portion, and it was flavorful and had a bit of a spicy kick to it. Yum.\n\nI've yet to experience boneless hot braised chicken as good as the stuff at Bo Fung (seriously. AMAZING), but this came a little close. \n\nI'd definitely come back here to try other dishes.","stars":4}

My dad lives nearby and we stop here often and enjoy their food. The person on the phone explained that they were out of a lot of things due to the game. It wasn't a problem and we had anticipated it by having some backups ready. I ordered what I could and went over to pick it up.\n\nWhen I arrived, the guy behind the counter looked at the order, frowned and then excused himself into the kitchen. What followed was four or five sustained minutes of yelling and fighting as the employees shouted at one another over promising food that wasn't available. At one point a frazzled employee came out to see if I was okay. I said that I was being waited on and wasn't in a hurry. He asked if I wanted a hug and I declined. Eventually, the original employee came out with my order. I paid as normal, went home and enjoyed the food.\n\nI understand that SBS is a busy day for restaurants, but being put in a position of having to listen to employees yell and scream at one another was unprofessional. I know tempers can run hot in kitchens, but since the kitchen is right next to the register and visible from the street, I hope the employees will be more mindful in the future about how they represent the restaurant.","stars":3}

The Burrito Fajita and regular fajitas are two of my favorites - both always delicious.  Service here is always excellent, prompt, and attentive - putting most other STL restaurants to shame.  Their restaurant space is large enough that you never have to wait too long (or at all).  Finally, the price is right.  Although it is not as cheap as a taco shop, size portions here are large (including alcohol), justifying their prices (not to mention CHEAP lunch specials on weekdays).

She didn't even bother to verify and her manager was just as rude. To be honest they treated me as though I was trying to steal two funky pretzels. Even though I had just made a purchase, the pretzels were just forgotten. The second time I went to their kitchen a different woman had indicated that they didn't have any croissants. So I selected another sandwich using toast. After I had paid for my order then that's when the woman had indicated that they didn't have toast for that sandwich either.

My 3rd cube was not very full and I asked if we could empty it quickly so it wouldn't take up more space.  He said that would make his day easier transporting them so he helped out and got everything inside before the rain hit.  Movers came and unloaded.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"My boyfriend and I had tried this out, as we enjoy trying new places to eat.  However, we were not impressed and we actually got sick from the products (we hadn't eaten anything else that day).  First off, it took them ten minutes to even acknowledge our presence to order (they were nice and apologized, but seriously?) and when we did order and sit down, the food was out within five minutes.  We found this odd, as we understand waiting for our food might have been something we needed to do as he had gotten the soft fish tacos and I had gotten the chicken enchilada plate.  All I have to say was, disgusting and never again.  It was like it was previously frozen and they threw it in a microwave to heat it up, it wasn't even hot -- it was luke warm.  We tried it anyway and as I said, big mistake.  Both of us took a bite or so, since we paid so much and tried to stomach it a bit before we just gave up and threw at least 75%+ in the trash.  We could have gone to the management to complain but we had so much we were doing that day we just decided to cut our losses.  Yet, we still didn't get anything done, as we got sick.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, ever.  If you enjoy this, great.  We just didn't have any sort of experience that would allow a second visit.","stars":1}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I'll keep this short, since this isn't the most positive review. Big Daddy's is right down the street from my work, and I've gone here a few times on Friday nights with my coworkers. The last time I was here wasn't the best experience, but I will say that I have had more pleasant experiences with smaller groups, so it may have just been the fact that on this particular evening, our group was so large.\n\nWe were in a group of 10 or so, and we sat outside on the patio at some tall tables. I had maybe 4 drinks. Of these 4 drinks, I had to get out of my seat and go to the bar to get 3 of them. Now, I'm not so lazy that getting up is a big deal to me, I just expect tthe waiter or waitress to continue to serve me when I am eating and drinking in a restaurant. I was just a little dissatisfied with their customer service, which has never been very good on the nights we went there, which was usually a Friday. \n\nFinally, it seems to me that they don't know how to cook wings. I have ordered wings on more than one occasion, and you have to tell them to fry them hard if you want them to be fully cooked. Otherwise, they come out a little under done, and the meat is watery and slippery. Now, they're not so under-done that they're going to risk a health scare, but I guess I just like my wings cooked a little longer. Call me crazy, but I want the meat on my wings to be firm. \n\nIn summation: while I have had not-so-positive experiences here, I have also had some not-so negative experiences here, and I wanted to let everyone know that I edited this review because I recently went out with the same co-worker who caused my original review of Big Daddy's to be so negative, and I figured out that the common denominator in these situations was her, not necessarily the restaurant. I also added a star. I wouldn't mind going back without this coworker to see what kind of experience I have.","stars":3}

I purchased a slice from Kroger, which receives daily deliveries from the bakery. \n\nI've heard a lot of great buzz about this shop and have seen the Pinterest worthy photos of the storefront. When I splurged on one slice (~$11) for Valentine's Day, I had high expectations. I selected one of my favorite flavors, red velvet, which looked like a piece of art with the beautiful, glittery roses on the side. \n\nUnfortunately, I was disappointed. Perhaps it's due to my excessively sweet (and not necessarily sophisticated) palette, but I thought it was really bland. The cake itself was not memorable and slightly dry. The roses made out of frosting had a creamy, fluffy texture, which was fine - but it was flavorless and tasted just like ordinary whipped cream. The only sweet component was the buttercream frosting in between the layers of the cake. \n\nNext time I am craving for red velvet, I will go elsewhere. Sorry Cake Bake, you are so pretty, but you just didn't do it for me!","stars":2}

The menus were sticky & gross, the table had dried sour cream or cheese on it, the seat was full of crumbs, the carpeted floor was a hot mess, the light on the wall at our table was incredibly dusty and gross and both my silverware and my husbands silverware were dirty with dried lettuce on them. Even my husbands napkin was dirty. I just felt icky even eating bc my hands constantly felt unclean there. The server was a really nice kid but seemed new. I was a young server once though & I remember what it was like so nothing bad to say about him. The chips were so greasy that they glistened so we didn't eat them.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I was working a gig in Webster Groves last week, and my client took our group to Roadhouse for lunch to celebrate the end of a project. What should have taken one hour took two-plus, and the food was simply meh.\n\nUntil that Friday, I hadn't been to Roadhouse. I had tried the black bean hummus when the restaurant had a booth at the first LouFest, but that was it. When we arrived at the restaurant, the place was packed, but we were seated within five minutes. The decor was neat - a wall took us through music history, which I loved. The place was oddly decorated for Mardi Gras and already was promoting the February event, though, which was confusing.\n\nLooking over the menu, I noticed that there weren't a ton of vegetarian entrees, but I was happy enough with an order of hummus\/pita and a side of sweet potato fries. Others at the table decided on a variety of burgers, fish, steak and chicken dishes.\n\nIt was a while before our server returned to take our orders. When we saw her, we informed her that another person would soon join us, but we were cool with placing our own orders immediately. One person also mentioned that he'd place a to-go order near the end of our meal. \n\nThe other member of our party soon joined us, but he didn't get to order until the server returned with our meals about 30 minutes later. In the meantime, most of us needed refills or had questions about other things. By the time our friend got his food, most of us had finished eating. It then was a long time before the one person could place his to-go order or any of us again received refills. \n\nThe food itself was ok. My black bean hummus was a little bland and very cold, but it came with plenty of pita. I had been excited about my cinnamon-sugar sweet potato fries, but they didn't have much taste to them. I tried dipping them in barbqueue sauce, and that didn't fix them. Others seemed to be ok with their meals, though I didn't specifically ask how they were and nobody was moaning with delight. \n\nOnce we had all finished and my friend finally received his to-go order, we had been there for two hours. Even getting the slip back after running the solo credit card took a long time - and we were the only people in the joint by that time. Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the place. I might return if I were working with that group again and they pushed for it , but I'd suggest other nearby places first.","stars":2}

I set the temp to 65 (lowest it'll go) nothing seems to happen and minutes later the thermostat auto-adjusts up to 67 and stays there.

The mussels sauce was a white wine bacon base and we had to keep the leftovers for some bread dipping. We all had salads: the beet salad was great. The beets were fresh and flavorful, and the goat cheese really added an extra kick to the dish. The Eat your Garden salad was a huge mixed greens salad with a great vinaigrette to top it off. My mom had the special asparagus salad that was also very good. The scallops and the street tacos were the entrees that we all had and both were excellent. The scallops were garnished with radishes to really give the plate a pop of color. The chimichurri sauce on top of the scallops was awesome (I wanted more!).

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"The owner needs to hire someone that knows something about queueing theory to work out the flow of diners in this restaurant.  The main reason I rated it two stars is because of the preposterous way they handle orders.  The night we went, there was one worker at one register.  The line was past the entry door.  On average (yes, I timed it) it took two minutes to take an order if the diners had no questions.  They have a second register open, but it is for to-go orders only.  OF COURSE, the couple in front of us didn't see the sign and when they approached the register, the worker took their to-go order and it took about three minutes to get them sorted.  I would have thought they would have opened a second register, but another review says if they do that, then no one has a place to sit.  So, what this means it that the customer gets to be inconvenienced at the cost of the owner's poor planning.\n\nHaving lived in Texas, I wonder why they just don't set up a cafeteria-type serving line.  Even snooty BBQ places in Texas do that and the serving line tends to clear pretty quickly.  They may not have enough room to do that here.\n\nThey also need to clearly mark where the self-serve station is for soft drinks and tea.  It's to the left of the kitchen area if you have trouble finding it like we did.\n\nServers bring the food to your table.  Not sure how they are getting paid to work.  Not sure if they get tips.\n\nThe food was very good.  My wife had a brisket sandwich from the kid's menu.  Very good brisket.  Good smoke ring on the meat.  Also came with a cookie!  I ordered the Wood Fired Chicken Salad.  It was pretty darned phenomenal.  The produce in the salad was very fresh.  The sliced chicken looked wood fired, but it didn't taste particularly wood fired.  The chicken was chilled, which may be why.\n\nI would recommend trying this place at non-traditional dining times.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"It was a few weeks prior when my best friend, Brandon, had his 20th birthday. As a gift I decided to treat him, his girlfriend, and I to a meal of his choice downtown. Brandon wanted to pick a place that was out of the usual of our preferences-- Cracker Barrel, Buffalo Wild Wings, and such. His selection was the entertaining, yet irritatingly witty Dick's Last Resort on the hustling corner of Maryland and Illinois in Indianapolis. So,it was decided.\n\nThe time was around 7 or so as we were seated. Our waiter-- who resembled a bipolar version of Zach Galifinakis, if he was a Pok\u00e9mon fanatic-- took the drink order (all ice waters) and proceeded to roast us trio. Me: Andy Dick's twin brother if he was a mute android. Brandon: A hapless wannabe hipster whose only girlfriend was once his right hand. Giovanna (Brandon's girlfriend): \"That face\" of whose always in the minds of the guys in the locker room. What fun...\n\nEventually all orders were placed. I cannot recall what the loving duo ordered, but me, the third wheel of sorts, ordered the \"Shrimpers Paradise\". An appetizer was selected which was traditional mozzarella cheese sticks. Once that was brought out, my mouth started to water. I ate it. The cheese sticks were rather bland. Disappointingly, thought probably predictable enough, they tasted like good ol' Tyson's freezer brand cheese sticks; the sort of type that were semi crunchy, zestfully gooey, but had the taste aroma that one could recognize that there was some freezer frost still present on them. Also, there was a gritty like texture too. There was still hope for dinner no doubt in the mean time.\n\nSoon enough dinner came out. My plate had a small assortment of two types of shrimp: butterfly styled and broiled. The side items contained a couple scoops of Cajun-like rice and green beans. Good lord, how awful those green beans looked. They seemed melancholy, drooping downwards like a tiring old dog with out an ounce of hope, but plenty green. Why not try 'me? After all, I have been making an effort to eat more lean. The flavor seemed to absent. Oh how they were very watery and tasted like welting lettuce. There was some sort of funk to them that was somewhat a wee bit appalling. The rice: There was no hope for that either. Tasted like the Stoufer's freezer brand that lacked flavor, zest, and possibly all the more visible nutrition that could've been... As for the shrimp? Simply... okay. I could make out the taste of the Gulf where it was like fished from, so that was pleasing a bit. Plenty buttery that brought out more zing. But I won't beat out around the bush, they were just as good as Red Lobster's I suppose. Certainly made the shrimp from Bubba Gump's look like the Joe Namath of shell fish.\n\nThe price was outrageous too, so I probably won't be coming around this establishment any day in the near future. My loyal friend and his girlfriend were very gracious so that made me all the more appreciated, so there was that light at the end of this meal. Thanks for the 2 out of 5 star service Dick's!","stars":2}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"The initial things I noticed: this place has such a lovely atmosphere, my server (Megan) was attentive and warm (without being overbearing). Great staff. I was worried about service from the mixed reviews this place seemed to get, but service was a strong point (so perhaps that was an area they improved on?) \n\nFor dinner, the entire meal consisted of small rolls with honey-garlic butter, butternut squash soup with ham hock and potatoes, lamb wellington, and blood orange dessert.\n\nThe rolls were warm and fresh, and I asked for more just to be able to taste the simply delicious honey garlic butter. The honey was not too sweet and struck a balance with the garlic. I feel that most butternut squash soups tend to be one-note (unless served with a dollop of something), but this soup had more dimension to it a la the meaty ham hock and potatoes. \n\nTo me, there seemed to be a theme of duality present here. My lamb was served two ways: in the wellington style and in merguez meatballs with sauce. I feel like this dish was disjointed, as one had nothing to do with the other. But if you're someone who likes to have variety in your plate or you like eating tapas style\/sharing, this would not be a bad choice. I thought the wellington would have been better off by itself with an extra piece of lamb in puff pastry or with a simple vegetable\/merguez preparation, so as not to overshadow the wellington's lighter flavor with meatballs in sauce. Both were tasty, it's just that the dish wasn't cohesive.\n\nDessert was memorable. Again, duality. There were 2 plates: a creme brulee with orange undertones presented next to a plate of braised blood oranges,white chocolate ganache, dehydrated blood oranges,  and a serving of cranberry sorbet on top of a small bed of pistachios. It was an interactive dish and a complex dessert. My one criticism of this dish is that the cranberry sorbet had no place there. Since it held a different type of acidity from the blood oranges, it distracted from the core flavors. The sorbet was true to the taste of cranberry, however, and reminded me of the holidays.\n\nA place with the combination of a traditional ambiance AND innovative dishes is hard to find. I like that the chef takes risks here, but still maintains classic technique. I would recommend this place and I will be coming back next time I'm in the area.","stars":5}

Individual cakes are $3.99 and I would compare them to a very large cupcake.

Although the icing isn't \"perfect\" looking like some cupcake companies - looks aren't everything. These products are fresh, hand done, and oh, so yummy!! \nThe cakes were super moist and not too dense. Our family shared all the flavors and everyone like each flavor. \nThey offer minis, full sized Bundt cakes, and gluten free options.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Ordered takeout, due to the 'ronademic.  Was able to park just a couple of spots from the front door and easily pick up my order at the bar.\n\nWe had empanada columbiana for an appetizer.  These little empanadas are fried cornmeal rather than flour, making them extra tasty.  Beef and potato stuffing were good too, with a spicy sauce mixture for dipping\/pouring.\n\nFor entrees, we went with lomo saltado and pollo a la brasa.  Both are good size portions for the price.  The pollo is a half bird, albeit a smaller bird.  But the flavor of this bird was exquisite.  Both the dark and white meat were tender and moist, with flavor all the way through to the bone.  The skin was also crispy and flavorful, without being greasy.  Rice was standard white rice.  The beans were very savory and well flavored.  The lomo saltado's beef medallions were very tender and tasty.  The sauce for the dish was highly savory too, nice and rich.\n\nAlfajores were the dessert.  These are shortbread butter cookies filled with dulce de leche.  They were rich, and we liked them quite a bit.  But here's my one gribe.  It was three small cookies (half dollar size) for $7.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I like the customizability of this place - you get to pick whatever flavors of fro-yo you want, toppings, and sauces!  They have a decent selection of flavors but every time I come I feel like I always end up getting the same three - pomegranate, mango, and chocolate (yes, they've got cuter names, but I can't remember them). The toppings vary greatly - anywhere from healthy fruity options to sinfully scrumptious chocolates too!  I know a lot of reviewers have said that the fruit didn't look fresh - I agree, a couple of the fruit options looked like the antithesis of appealing so I avoided them.  I ended up settling for some raspberries and a few white chocolate chips.  The fro-yo was good, but a little more tart than I am used to.\n\nA couple of complaints I have about this pace are the fruit toppings (which I already mentioned) and the difficulty to get a sample.  They don't have any spoons out so , it's tough to know what you'll like.  Also, just a heads up on pricing - they only have humongous bowls which just make you want to out more fro-yo in your bowl than you want.  Plus, when I was there, one of my friends accidentally got charged for the weight of her spoon as well!  By the time she realized it, it was a little late to get it adjusted.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Ok, so I'm writing this from the perspective of a hospitality industry employee. So I have a little different view of this place than most. But I still love it. \n\nLet me start out with telling why I only gave four stars and not five, and it has nothing to do with smoke. I hate the decor of this place, the red lighting and the somewhat tacky retro-chique louge atmosphere could have kept me out of this place forever, but I find my self going in week after week to visit Indy's best bartenders. \n\nIf you have an aversion to smoke, stay clear. This is a Martini and CIGAR BAR...for anyone who complains about the smoke, you're just being silly, thats like complaining about the noise at a Colts game. The bar makes not apologies about, nor do they try to hide the fact that they are in fact one of Indy's finest purveyors of fine smoking products. \n\nThat being said, lets get on to the good stuff. As I said before the 'tenders at Nicks are my favorite in the city. Funny guys with a somewhat cynical view of the world they work in. If you wanted to come up with a group of guys to work in a place that were more different that the somewhat pretentious client\u00e8le, you couldn't do better than Mr. McVey. A really friendly, easy to get along with kinda guy who digs soccer and a good drink. \n\nTwo things also stand out to me about Nicky Blaine's that the average person may not be aware of. One, they have the best Italian sub you can buy...anywhere...ever...period. The Vesuvius Sub is amazing, and if you order it with out the peppercini's I will personally break a chair over your head. The second thing is the perfect height of the bar in relation to the chairs that after a long day of waiting tables allows me to relax my head on my arms and feel perfectly comfortable while I knock back some Bud Diesels.\n\nThis is no doubt one of my favorite local haunts, although you won't find me there on a weekend night, if for no other reason that the general Nicky's crowd is a bunch of wannabe high-class desk jockeys trying to impress....? Anyway, if you can handle the d-baggery that tends to come in to Nick's then check it out on the weekends when it's packed, otherwise, come during the week when business is a little lighter and you can get to know you bartenders and bar backs a little better.\n\nP.S. don't get pissed if the guy washing glass ware won't get you a drink, he isn't allowed.","stars":4}

I've taken lots of people there and they all seem to enjoy the food (no one has ever complained).

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"The people on the St. Louis Enterprise lot were friendly, helpful, and extremely professional.  Which is why it's such a shame that one of their Customer DISservice representatives ruined my experience and garnered the company a One Star rating.\n\nMy husband and I were very satisfied with the service at the Enterprise lot.  But once we got home, we received an email receipt for our rental which was incorrect.  We were charged $2.97 per day more than we agreed to.\n\nIt's not a huge amount of money ($27.88), but it's the principle of thing.  You make a deal and you keep it. And when you travel, all those little charges add up, so you have to be diligent.  I thought a quick email to Enterprise Customer Service would get us a quick credit and all would be fine.\n\nBut NOOOOOO.  Marketta at Enterprise Customer DISservice proceeded to point out all the ways I didn't know what I was talking about, nor did I know how to add, subtract or multiply.  Marketta didn't bother to look at my reservation (the number was on the contact form AND I included it in my email), but simply maintained I didn't know what I was talking about.\n\nAfter many back-n-forth, time-wasting, frustrating emails, I sent her a PDF of my reservation.  Did she admit her mistake and credit us?\n\nHahahaha!  Of course not.  She put the charges through at the regular rate, took off the 5% Plus Customer Discount we'd received at the Enterprise lot, and charged us an extra $.66 for bringing her inability to perform her job (Customer Service, remember?) into the light.\n\n$27.88.  A ridiculously small amount to quibble over.  An even more ridiculous amount to lose a good customer over, but that's what Marketta at Enterprise Customer DISservice did.","stars":1}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Bru Burger is consistently good and it is always busy. I love the Mexicali Barbecue Burger with the black bean patty or the impossible burger. They have lots of good vegetarian options and a good selection of Indiana beers on tap. The fries are good, but I wish they'd add a side salad option to complement the burgers. The outdoor seating area is great for people watching on Mass Ave and the Cultural Trail. Tourists flock to Bru Burger, so the wait can be a 1-2 hour wait if it is a Friday or Saturday evening or if there's a show at the Murat. \n\nThe major downside is that the interior is extremely loud and has terrible acoustics, so you end up hoarse if you try to have a conversation. I hope that they make some acoustical improvements to make it better for customers.","stars":4}

Food was fine and I was thinking I could come back from time to time... that was until I was signing the check and a small roach scurried across the corner of the table.

Because it took so long to get my pizza, I had to get it to go and take it back to work with me.  I thought I would give Blaze another shot last week, but again they only had three people working during lunchtime and the line was too long to wait.  So, I left and went somewhere else.  They need to staff more people during lunchtime.  I went to Mod in Kirkwood yesterday, and Mod has much better service.  They had five people working and I didn't have to wait long to get my pizza.

That means if you inherit some relative's jewelry that isn't to your taste, you can either sell it here OR you can have it made into something you like. \n\nEach time I've stopped in, I've gotten that \"One of these things is not like the others\" feeling when I compare myself with the other clientele.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Living in a variety of Indianapolis communities over the past 10 years, I've come across a lot of places with menus that look very similar, with the exact same foods featured. Then, I moved to Irvington last year and encountered some wonderful longstanding neighborhood favorites, such as Foon Ying and the grand Oriental Inn. While it's true that Oriental Inn's Arlington Avenue surroundings aren't the most inspiring, the inside of the restaurant is very clean and has the classic decor of the Chinese restaurants I remember from my childhood--places where you went for a sit down meal, not a mere dine and dash. On my first visit there, I was intrigued that they offered kim chee fried rice. Salivating at the thought of these two things cooked together, a rare sight around here, I ordered that and an equally enticing plate of rumaki. I immensely enjoyed both dishes, but what really stood out to me was the friendly customer service and how the servers and the owners genuinely seemed to care what you think of their food and readily make suggestions on how best to enjoy it. For example, one of the owners saw me dipping my rumaki in hot mustard sauce and insisted I try their house hoisin sauce with it. He then compromised, saying \"Okay, I can tell you like your sauces spicy, so let's mix the two.\" He mixed a little hot mustard in with the hoisin, and it was delicious. I appreciated the guidance. Later, I complimented my waitress on the rumaki, and she told me exactly how to make it at home, sharing some tips I never would have thought of. So, I was thrilled with my dining experience. Recently, I brought my wife back with me, reluctantly agreeing to get a carryout order. I quickly learned that they give their carryout customers the same hospitality as those who dine in. I was told it would be about a 10-minute wait and that I should have a seat at a nearby table. A waitress brought us a pot of hot tea to drink while we waited. Later, the hostess brought us wonton chips, kim chee and pickled celery to snack on while we waited. It wasn't a long wait, but we were hungry and it was nice to snack a bit. That was most assuredly the first time I ever left a 20 percent tip for a a carryout order! Now my wife is sold on the place, too, thank God.\n\nThe food is great at Oriental Inn, and there's a better variety of dishes than you'd get at the average local Chinese place. But, what I believe will really keep me coming back is the friendliness of the staff and their efforts to expose you to new foods and preparation methods you may not have considered before. So many times I've been met by grouchy hosts and hostesses and unexciting food at Chinese restaurants. These, in my mind, have been lumped into an alphabet soup of random Chinese names. Friendly places like Oriental Inn are the ones you remember -- for a long time.","stars":5}

Beer is not my favorite of local variety but do enjoy several especially champagne velvet pilsner on a hot summer day. I try to stop by here on a monthly basis.

I called a few times during business hours on separate occasions to have a question answered. I heard ringing until my call reached voicemail. Nonetheless, I still came in that Friday evening. The counter service was average. The space is kept quite organized and clean. I love the artwork decorating the walls everywhere in the bakery and cafe. As I made my dessert order, I noticed that the staff member put on a fresh pair of gloves before handling the cupcakes.\n\nI ordered the following:\n1. Chocolate Turtle cupcakes - Moist and rich chocolate cake. Seemed like it might've had a coffee taste to it, but it could've just been the caramel and chocolate combined together. This is sure to completely satisfy a chocolate sweets craving!\n2. Sweet Potato cupcakes - Moist and spiced. The frosting paired well with the cake. Perfect for the season.

The side of bacon I ordered was the thinnish, greasiest and most tasteless bacon I've ever tasted.  My husband had a breakfast sandwich, which was much better, but that's not saying much.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Stayed here recently with my bff, as we intended to go out for her sister's birthday, and didn't want to drive back to the 'burbs afterward. Her sister wound up deciding not to come out, but we were still happy we stayed here!\n\nPrice was reasonable (coming from Chicago, I thought it was cheap for a downtown hotel!), and the front desk staff was pretty nice. The elevators are digital, so you select the floor you want on a digital screen before you enter, and there are no buttons on the inside (except the standard emergency call button). This looks cool, but I didn't love it. If a group gets on the elevator with you, and you're on a high floor, you have no idea how many times or on which floors you will stop before you get to your floor. Alternatively, you don't know if someone getting off on your floor is actually staying there or if they're following you. Since I was staying here with my friend, it was fine, but if I were staying here alone, I would actually be a bit concerned. I strongly prefer to see other people get in and push their floor themselves, so I can see where they're going and know if they are doing their own thing or being creepers.\n\nThe room was large and had a nice view of the arch. Beds were comfortable and there was a large desk we took over for the purpose of getting ready in front of the full-length mirror. The bathroom was pretty cramped and the shower was not nice! This was actually the low point of the stay- the showerhead was coming off the wall a bit, and the walls and fixtures were tired and not totally clean. The pipes were clearly jammed from usage and not being properly cleaned out, so the tub backed up while I was showering. In my relatively short shower (seriously, probably only about 7 minutes), the water was pooled up above my ankles. \n\nLocation was awesome, and we loved being able to get drinks in the 360 bar upstairs without leaving the building. We also went over to Ballpark Village and were able to leave our coats in the room and just dash across the street. Perfect! If we go out in St. Louis again, I'd definitely want to stay here again, but I'd probably shower at my friend's place instead.","stars":3}

I didn't say why but no one asked either.  The woman took us back to the exact same small room and tried to seat us 2 tables down from our original location.

This should really been moved to the other side of the booths where there were fewer vendors an more room for the line so they wouldn't block the sidewalk.   \n\nThere were a few vendors with items to purchase for yourself or would make a good gift for someone. Some items such as the steins were too pricey but most were affordable.\n\n I enjoyed watching the demonstration of making wooden figurines.  You could even select one to cut and take home.

Today was one of those days where we tried someplace new... enter Abuelo's. Beautiful restaurant, great atmosphere, and very kind, professional staff. Our party had four, plus a child, and we were seated immediately, chips and salsa were already on the table. They offered three different salsas: a mild, tomato based salsa, a tart, almost fruity, tomatillo salsa, and then a spicier, pepper based salsa (my favorite). We also ordered guacamole and queso for an appetizer. The guacamole was terrific I wanted another bowl, the queso not so much; it seemed like it came from a jar. Their menu offers a wide selection of traditional, house, and Tex-Mex entrees. I ordered the 10oz ribeye which came with two enchiladas (I got chicken and carnitas), potatoes, and beans. I rib-eye tasted delicious and was cooked to the temp I ordered; however, it wasn't the best cut of meat, too thin for a ribeye in my opinion. The potatoes were smashed with peppers and cheese, very tasty, but under seasoned. My guess is the water wasn't salted when the potatoes were cooked. I added S&P on the table and they were great. The beans were wonderful, I only got two bites, my daughter ate the rest! The tacos really tempted me, my only hesitation is there's not a taco sampler where I could choose a few myself, so I'll have to try them next time. Like I said, the staff was really top notch. Overall, it was a good meal, I'd go back for sure.","stars":3}

The drinks were pretty good, but the tapas were wonderful taste sensations.  We had an amazing scallop dish that melted in the mouth and embarked on a wonderful food journey through the meal.  Our server was helpful in recommending dishes and recommending good things around St. Louis for us to do in the evening.  The downtown is dead by 7 or 8 pm on a Friday so the only downside of the place is that you'd then have to drive out to other neighborhoods for good bars to continue your evening.\n\nHighly recommended for after work happy hour or a meal downtown.

Seriously, Nadine's is, to quote Frank Costanza, \"the place to be!\" Reasonably priced drinks, fun staff, gigantic patio with Cardinals on the big screen, good food... All the makings for a bar I'd never leave, with one key exception: GAMES!\n\nI can eat, booze, watch baseball, and pee on the toilet seat at home, but I can't shoot pool or throw darts. Hence, I must venture out, and usually wind up at Nadine's. I remember when they had a pool table and two dart machines in the back room. Those were good times. Then, they traded the billiards for more tables and the ability to host parties. A bummer, but a business move I can understand. Then, one of the dartboards vanished... Now, to ring in 2014, no more darts! Just a lone, hulking Golden Tee machine. As if golf wasn't boring enough in person, we need to virtualize it sans sunshine and go-carts?!\n\nI can see how having a pool table is a big commitment, but why get rid of a dartboard? It takes up roughly the same amount of space as the average beer-swilling oaf clinging to the wall. My buddy and I drop a minimum of $5 a week in the machine, and spend at least $40 at the bar. Multiplied by 48 weeks (allowing for illness, vacation, and zombie attacks) that comes to $2160. Without billiards OR darts to play, these glassy eyes just might start to wander... So, please Nadine, BRING BACK THE DARTS!!!","stars":4}

First the menu was changed, shortened considerably. There are some classic Thai dishes missing. The prices have been raised considerably. For two people who got entrees only we paid $34.00. Papaya salad is now $10.99. The most I had ever paid for one was $ 8.99. We have been to every local Thai place, and this is by far the most expensive.

It is not gourmet, it is not gastronomy, it is not high-end dining.  What it is, however, is a very sweet, very fast Chinese restaurant that serves large quantifies of deliciously saucified dishes such as bean curd with garlic sauce and vegetable lo mein, as well as incredibly soft and fluffy white rice.  I ordered over the phone and my order was hot and ready (and correct) when I arrived.  I am a sucker for salty, saucy Chinese food and First Wok did not disappoint.  I will be going back.  Often.\n\nBonus:  there is a coupon on coupons4indy.com right now - $1 off $10, $2 off $20, etc.","stars":4}

This included releasing a wiring harness improperly wedged between a body mount and the urea tank...also a check of the brakes, check engine light, and overall exam of the tiny beast.  \n\nI offhandedly mentioned the sunroof issue after paying my $58....he pulled the car in the garage...and adjusted the damn sunroof...which was off !

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"The ways for a drinking establishment to score points with me are twofold: offering low-cost drinks and providing me an easy voyage home after a night of drinking done right. Par Lounge more than satisfies both criteria. \n\nOriginally, my interest was piqued on a walk to the Hi Pointe Theater next door. Months later on a Thursday night, a decision to try a new watering hole led to an investigation of the Par Lounge. At first, I was put off by the absence of patrons (likely due to it being a Thursday night), but this made finding seating extremely easy. \n\nBeing as savvy as I am, my first question for the bartender was \"What's cheap?\" Fortunately, the answer was everything. This is the beauty of Par:  their \"happy hour\" is basically always. With the exception of the standard drinking nights (Friday and Saturday), \"happy hour\" lasts from essentially open to close. I had quite the time, and plenty of drinks, for less than $15. \n\nMy complaints of Par Lounge are few. For one, the digital jukebox is somewhat of a crap shoot. You may be stuck waiting an hour just to hear the song your dollar says you love so much. In fact, despite offering an enjoyable variety of tunes, it is more costly to play a song in the bar than to purchase said song on iTunes. There's no beer on tap (only bottles), so the grocery store down the street is a viable competitor for beer purchases. Also, the absence of patrons severely handicapped any opportunities for mingling entertainment, or even people watching. However, this flaw is advantageous for those who want to interact within their own group. For those who must drive, parking may be difficult to find (with the exception of extreme cold, it's within walking distance for me).\n\nThe key question to ask, then, is \"Will I go back?\" For the Par Lounge, the answer is absolutely, thanks to their cheap booze and proximity to my home.","stars":4}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"This place is brand new!  The CarMax company just broke into the St. Louis market this fall which is HUGE for them and St. Louis (they have this branch and the one in St. Peters).  We went one night shortly after they opened to try to sell my old car since I got a new more awesome car and was having issues selling the old one on Craiglist.  We were very impressed with building itself and the staff inside.  Since the building is new it obviously looks very nice and has pretty good lighting.  It is very spacious and open.  \n\nWe were greeted upon arrival and asked what we were interested in (selling a car or buying a new one).  Obviously we wanted to get an appraisal to sell my old car.  We checked in and sat in some chairs in a waiting area nearby.  If you're hungry or thirsty they have a water fountain or some vending machines.  It'd be cooler if they offered like a Keurig and some coffees or some fruit snacks like the Audi dealer or the Valvoline Oil Place did.  But, at least they have a vending machine! :)  \n\nWe were finally greeted by our appraiser who went over how the process works, what they look for, what to expect, ect.  Basically they take your car for 15 minutes or so and look over everything on the outside and inside of the car according to a checklist that they have.  Then depending on the miles on your car they take it for a test drive.  Since mine had 95,000 miles they had to test drive my car (which is about 1 mile or so).  Then they come back and go over everything with you and give you an offer.  This offer is good for 7 days.  At that point you can either sell it before 7 days or if it's after get it reappraised.  They come up with the number they offer you by comparing your car against their database of cars up for auction at their company and another large auction house company.  It compares your cars condition, color, age, and miles on it.  While the appraiser is looking at your car you can either wait around or go grab a bite to eat like we did.  \n\nWe came back the next night to sell my car (long story short my name technically wasn't on the title as my uncle had bought it but I paid the car loan!).  After doing some paper work and one final look over you finish up the process.  Then they give you a check that you have to deposit into the bank and you're good to go!\n\nAll of the staff was very friendly.  They made sure to do everything they could to make the entire process as seamless and easy as they could.  They worked with us to provide the best experience possible.

The Wild Chicken was very spicy and the Waffles were nothing out of the ordinary. Decent enough was the Buttermilk Maple Syrup, which had good flavor, but it was cold. I think it would benefit by being serving warmed. We asked for silverware when our food arrived and the server seemed annoyed and tried to say some type of self-deprecating comment like, \"I can't do anything right today.\" We ignored it, finished our breakfast, and paid the bill. \n\nBack to the snobby patrons: As we were waiting for our bill to arrive I heard a lady who was waiting for a table (just like everybody else was doing) stop and ask a very busy server for a glass of water since she had to wait so long- Really???

On past vehicles my only experience was with a large company that starts with the letter Z, whose installation looked amateurish compared to what Clear Bra Indy did on this vehicle.

This allowed rock dings to chip paint away at the edges, where I had to touch up the paint.  Clear Bra Indy installed the film for less than the competition and it was perfect.  I had to look carefully to see that there was even a clear film on the hood.  The film wrapped around the edges to protect against edge dings.

The server tells us that we can not only \"call a server\" kind of like tapping the button on an airplane for a flight attendant, but we can also order our food, and pay from this machine.  Oh, and there are news applications, and games.  \n\nMy friend and I being on the verge of real nerds grab it right after she takes our drink order to get the appetizer, it's not on there!  There were only 4 appetizers.  And it seems you have to tap everything twice to get it to register...  pfft. Fine.  \n\nBack to regular serving... So our lunches come and I had just asked our server for a refill on my tea, she says yes and then comes back to take orders at another table w\/o my tea!  So... I start looking for the server light on the Ziosk, and I could not find it, luckily my tea came before I died of thirst.\n\nAs disappointing as our first 2 attempts were, we easily found the \"pay\" button and I was REALLY impressed!!!  You can split checks from this machine, and gauge your tip based on percentage, and ask for a detailed or shortened reciept AND it prints it right there at the table!!!\n\nI might go back just to play with the Ziosk.","stars":4}

The food, wife's eggs were on the dry side, mine were good, hashbrowns crisp and crunchy cooked just right, pancakes nice and fluffy, coffee was fresh but just warm, not hot.

Was going to be a repeat customer, but there is someone dishonest entering receipt totals at the end of the day. No thanks.\n\nThis bar lost all future business from me just so a bartender could get a slightly bigger tip, which was already at 20% and honestly, I did not think the service warranted even that. I really don't think it was an honest mistake either because it is hard to misread these numbers.\n\n---------------\n\nAnother thing that didn't factor into my rating: When I cashed out, all I received was a credit card slip to tip on and sign with the tab total--nothing was itemized, and I have no idea how much I was charged for each individual drink or how many drinks.

I called the main number to schedule ONE appointment for the annual service of my furnace and heat pump purchased through Sears.  I should backup and say that I called in the spring and they told me to call in the fall.  Today, the agent tells me they can't do both services on the same day because the temperature in my area needs to be 60 degrees or lower.  In the spring, there wasn't a temperature dependency just call back in the fall.  After 43 minutes on the phone, 3 agents including one from corporate, I was confident that Sears doesn't have the ability to take care of me.  If I have to take time off to have them come to my house for a service call, I only want ONE service call.  Is that asking too much?","stars":1}

There was literally nothing that they moved that wasn't dropped or broken including items we thought were unbreakable.   We packed ourselves, and some items were double boxed but a lot of the boxes arrived with holes in and a valuable stained glass lampshade was broken beyond repair.\nWe had packed a lot of things in plastic totes; several of those arrived shattered.   Our king size bed set was dropped out of the truck - we saw it happen - and damaged beyond repair.   A steel microphone stand was broken\/snapped off.  Boxes clearly labeled \"fragile\" and \"this side up\" were brought in upside down and unceremoniously put down. I could go on and on.   How in the world did they do all this? \nI blame the people they hired to deliver our furniture in Colorado; I think they were straight off the street and untrained.  \nIn addition, after the move we discovered an expensive watch was missing from a bedroom we told them not to enter.   They did enter, and put items in there we didn't want there - we figured one of the guys was casing the room.  He would have had to search the closet to find the watch. \nIn our books, your name is mud.  We would never ever recommend Mayflower.","stars":1}

We could not find our server (who seemed overworked) so we had to go find our own forks. My Brussels were way undercooked to the point you could not get your fork in them.

This really does enhance your experience.  Their coffee menu has tasting notes and the worker gave me some suggestions as to what I might like.  The coffee ended up being delicious and brewed to perfection.  I also ordered a caramel latte, which had the sweetest, creamiest foam!  It was delicious. \n\nComet coffee ended up being a great place to get some work done and sip on caffeinated beverages.  I think the only thing that detracts from the experience is the location.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"We visited tonight (a Saturday) just before 6pm.  We were told it would be a 25+ min. wait.  We hung out at a bench outside and I was struck by how unkempt their front entrance is.  Very tall weeds, trash and a ton of cigarette butts in their landscaping.  Front railing with peeling paint and the building a very faded shade of yellow. As we were being led to our table, I couldn't help but notice how outdated and dingy their interior and decor are.  This location is severely overdue for a facelift.  When we were seated, the booth has so many crumbs, I even had to ask if they could wipe the seats.    Once I slid into the booth, my feet hit a slick of spilled drink and other stuff I could feel under my shoes.  I REALLY tried to ignore this because I didn't want to influence my family's dining experience.  I weighed my options for a) getting a wait person's attention, b) the possibility of getting another table during such a busy time and c) sucking it up and just ignoring it as best I could.  After many minutes had passed without seeing out waiter, I opted for 'c' and slid to the very end of the bench to minimize having my shoes slide around in the muck under the table.  \n\nWe placed our drink order, which didn't take too long and also ordered our dinner.  The wait for our food wasn't outrageous.  I had ordered the 11oz? center cut sirloin, which used to be called the Outback special, I think, with a blue cheese wedge salad for an upcharge, plus baked potato.  My husband ordered the fish tacos with fries and my daughter ordered the kids menu cheeseburger and fruit cup.\n\nI asked for their tiger dill sauce and once the waiter left, it was a really long time before we saw him again.  Wouldn't you know, right after he left, I discovered my baked potato was cold in some spots and just lukewarm in others.  While my steak was cooked to medium well (the temp I have always ordered), the steak itself seemed dry like maybe it had been held for awhile??  My husband, who is not easy to please, thought his tacos were quite good.  He also really liked his blackberry martini.  My daughter enjoyed her cheeseburger but we did ask if they could replace the large wedges of apples with a bowl of grapes because of my daughter's braces.\nI debated asking if they could reheat my baked potato but figured if service was getting progressively slower and I might not see our server for a good 20 minutes so I decided I would just take the potato home and eat it for lunch tomorrow.  The waiter was quick to bring our bill even though we told him when we ordered that we intended to have dessert and he told us he would take that order after we had dinner.  It was an excruciatingly long wait for dessert and when the waiter delivered the dessert, he wanted to know if we had our payment ready, I told him we planned on paying after we ate our dessert but he seemed hurried so I told him to give me a minute and I would have payment ready.  He took payment, we ate dessert and waited....and waited, then our waiter comes back to tell me he gave me the check without the dessert added so could I refigure my payment and have it ready for him in a minute.  NOW, I feel like all the hiccups and missteps are adding up and I was not having a great dining experience.  Our total time there was 2 hours.  Way too long for a party of 3 people for dinner (no appetizer) and dessert.  I had purchased about $500 in Outback gift cards at the end of this past school year for teachers and had $80 worth left over but we didn't spend the entire $80 and, at this point, I am kicking myself for not spending every penny of those gift cards because I would be hard pressed to want to come back.  While I know every restaurant has a bad evening, I can't overlook how grimy, unkempt and poor the service is.  I will find someone to give my remaining gift cards to and pass on this location for the foreseeable future.  I really wish I could share a much less critical review but this visit was a poor representation of a franchise with much higher standards.","stars":3}

The environment is clean and very cool, we did have to wait a bit despite having a reservation but that's ok.\n\nWe sat down, service was a little touch and go at the beginning but got much better once we sat down. Our waitress was so attentive and so helpful with ordering, not to mention patient with their being so many of us!\n\nI was unable to drink at the time because of pain medication, I did sneak a sip of one of the spritzers and it was SO good. General consensus of the table was that most hand made cocktails other than the spritzers (screw driver, mimosa) we're really watered down and almost pre-made which is disappointing because they're quite expensive.\n\nFood was great. We sampled everything on the brunch menu essentially, I got eggs and hashbrowns and it was really good! The eggs were flavorful but not overpowering and the hashbrowns we're the softer type (not crisp) which I love so it was great! However, no one overly raved about the food, it was a pleased consensus.\n\nShe was so attentive and speedy with the check as well! Overall a great experience, not quite 5 star, expected a little more \"wow\" for the food considering the price. Would I go back? Yes! I would love to try dinner!","stars":4}

There were 3 of us and we split 2 orders of the tacos which where the Al Pastor and the Tinga. They were served family style which was fun. Both the chicken and the pork were perfect. We also had the Poblano Fundido which I could eat everyday. Let me start my last point by saying that everyone working there was extremely nice and welcoming. However, we ran into some issues with our server. One or two opening kinks are to be expected. However, ours kept coming, hence the 4 stars.","stars":4}

A German\/American baker in St. Louis reversed the proportions of butter and flour. The rest is history. \n\nUpon arriving the business was preparing for close in about 15 minutes. There were still customers seated and a few at counter waiting for bakery items. All I was praying for was that they had not run out of Gooey Butter Cake. \n\nThe service was slow and we seemed to be ignored a bit. I get they were closing, but it seemed like a few staff was sweeping and dedicated to closing and not pushing customers through the line. \n\nOur party waited and scored the last Gooey Butter Slab as their store called it aka Gooey Butter Cake. Check out was fine, but again staff just seemed tired and to me that seemed unfriendly. \n\nUpon arriving back to friends home it was time for a taste test. My first one and WOW! I get the hype.

It was our first time there and he was patient as we reviewed the menu and asked him questions. \n\nWe ended up ordering some ribs, pulled pork and beef brisket. They offer three types of sauces: spicy, tangy or sweet. The dinner portions come with corn bread and two sides, which makes it a pretty good value. We ordered our food to go and it was ready within 10-15 min, so not a long wait considering how much food there was. \n\nUnfortunately ordering the meal to go might not have allowed this place to shine. The meat and sauce are packaged separately which might have cause the meats to dry out a bit. Fortunately the sauces were really great!

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I have used Two Men and a Truck twice to move in Indianapolis. The first time it was a good experience. The second time it was not. When I moved in July, the movers showed up  The movers showed up over 90 minutes late (I was given an arrival window of 10:30 - 11:30 and they showed up a bit after 1:00pm). Even though I called the office multiple times while I was waiting, no one answered and I was not able to get any information as to why they were so late and when they would be arriving. They did give me $50 off my  move for being late, but $50 off of $800 is a small percentage. \n\nThe movers started by carrying all boxes by hand to the truck instead of using the cart they had brought, which was much slower (this added to them taking longer to move items than was estimated, which ultimately cost me additional money).  The movers then spent another hour loading boxes on to the truck (after everything was already downstairs by the truck), which is significantly longer than it took them to move them out of the apartment. Since I was not watching them while loading on to the truck I assume that they were not working very hard and taking longer breaks. When I told them I thought they were not progressing very fast, one of the movers kept arguing with me instead of working on moving. He continued to argue with me even after I asked him to please work on moving items instead of arguing with me (again when I am paying by the hour to have someone move my items, I want to pay for them to move items not stand around and argue with me). Another mover took a 15 minute break when he thought I was not around to see this (this break was not noted on any of the forms, thus I was charged for this extra long break). I moved into a storage unit, and when the movers arrived to the storage unit they did unload things fairly quickly. However, when I looked at the boxes after they left, they had put all the boxes that were clearly labeled \"Fragile Glass\" on the bottom of piles (frequently with 4 or 5 heavy boxes on top of them). The entire point of labeling the boxes (which I was instructed to do) is to avoid these issues. It was extremely unprofessional and poor service.  I reported all these issues to the office, and they did eventually respond but no compensation was given beyond the $50 for late arrival. When I moved out of my storage unit into another apartment I went with a different moving company and was much happier. I would not use Two Men and a Truck in Indianapolis again.","stars":2}

The restaurant itself is quite beautiful, although I'm not sure why there's no sign for Mississippi Ave when you come from Chouteau, just two giant white pillars (too cool for signs?)\n\nThe meal was absolutely wonderful. They brought this very interesting bread to the table; extremely soft with caramelized onions on top. It was quite good and unlike any bread I've ever seen served at a restaurant with American cuisine.\n\nI almost never order fish anywhere but they were out of the wild boar and since the meal was free, I figured it was a good time to experiment! I'm so glad I did because the crispy red trout was to. die. for. \nJoe ordered some bacon wrapped pork tenderloins... he took one bite of my dish, we locked eyes, and then he pushed away his plate and we split the whole dish together and basically cleaned the plate.\n\nThe dish itself is quite a large portion, very good for the price. Two fairly large pieces of trout and we were able to split it evenly. The skin of the trout was so perfect. I'm not a fan of couscous but the pearl couscous that came with it was so delicious and sauteed nicely. The extremely thin slices of crisp spinach were the best. I had to fight Joe over them, le sigh.\nSomeone else at the table ordered the trout as well and kicked off all the skin, which was the best part!

The Pad See Ew is what I like to order on my first visit to a Thai restaurant to see how it compares to all the competition.  I went with the pork option at a medium spice level and the pork had an excellent flavor:  very deep and savory.  The noodles they use are the proper wide flat noodles and it is prepared with bits of broccoli, carrot, & celery.  The only negative was that the pork was overcooked and a bit dry.  Not bad though when eaten with the other bites.  The spice level seemed a bit lower than I expected, but that may be due to the surprisingly high spiciness of the Tom Yum soup that comes with the entree.\n\nThe entree also comes with a small egg roll (veggie) and side salad with a ginger dressing (it had a more complex flavor like they use more than ginger in their dressing.)\n\nI will say that the service was just okay.  I waited to be seated and when taken to my table, wasn't provided a menu.  The table had been washed off, but wasn't dry (I used my napkin to take care of it.)  I asked for a menu, and after receiving it, the service was pretty routine.\n\nApparently, there is a lunch buffet available too, but I somehow missed it on the menu I was given.  The website only lists the dinner menu, so if a buffet interests you, you will need to ask about it or be more thorough than I was.\n\nFun fact:  Bangkok Restaurant is in the location of the once popular Charlie & Barnie's Chili on Ohio Street.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Madeline's has been a staple for me to get all of the women in my life together... my wife, my daughter, my sister and my godmother.  It was a terrific experience: beautiful venue in the park, impeccable service and a bounty of good food.  It was well worth the higher per-person cost.... on par with the buffet at Caf\u00e9 O at the Chase.  Lately, that has changed.  In order to crowd more people into the arboretum, Madeline's has been setting up an adjacent tent for food service.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but it seems to be accompanied by lower quality selections and decidedly poorer service.  The selection of food is a bit more narrow and the quality seems to have fallen off... perhaps because they're attempting to serve a larger crowd.  We used to have an extremely attentive server that we were happy to lavish with a generous gratuity.  In more recent events, however, the service was practically non-existent.  I do not appreciate having to leave my party in order to get coffee or beverage refills or not having used plates removed in a timely manner.  A meal where you serve yourself and have no significant waitstaff is not an experience where I feel comfortable leaving any serious gratuity.  After several disappointing events, we have abandoned Madeline's as our Easter and Mothers Day tradition.","stars":2}

The pizza was bland, the sauce was thick and tasted like they just opened a can of Hunts tomato paste and slapped it on the pizza crust with a some pepperoni.  I had to ask for salt three times before the brought it so that was strike number 1. \n\nThe third visit I ordered a burger and cheese fries.  The burger is touted as a \"gourmet \" burger,  it isn't  even as good as a McDonald's burger. Strike 2. \n\nI got buffalo wings and fries on my fourth visit. The buffalo wings were slimy and that was it. Strike 3.\n\nKept going to the theater because I had purchased 12 Groupons so I needed to use them all, once all of my Groupon were gone, I had decided I wouldn't go back. Several months went by and I  don't go back. In April however, they showed Mary Poppins my sister and I went. She ordered an half order of sweet potato fries with a side of mayo & Pink Lemonade,  I ordered a full order of loaded cheese fries, and Pink lemonade. They didn't bring my sister her mayo for her fries they brought ketchup we which she hates and they brought me a 1\/2 order of cheese fries. It took me  asking four different waiters and more than half of the movie was over before the issue was fixed. Then they charged me for both orders of fries.

What I got was 90% bok choy and onion with a few random shreds of a carrot and zuchinni, literal shreds.  I asked to return it and they brought grilled asparagus which was randomly charred so was extremely bitter. My husband's shrimp fried rice was a small portion and had cruddy little bay shrimp in it, it was also so dosed in soy sauce it was super salty.

It's packed. I tell the hostess I'd like to order off the menu so we head to the back where the air is a little fresher.

Exactly what I wanted. Tender and spicy with a faint hint of sweetness at the end. Thankfully there's an ample amount of white rice if I need its relief after the exquisite agony of a Szechuan peppercorn. I ate less than 1\/4 of this and boxed the rest up. Portions are large!

Our table was on the second floor and overlooked the main seating of the first. I would comment that the chairs are questionable. They felt like sitting in an old aluminum chair that constantly wobbled, but this is a very small complaint. That aside, their drink menu is deep. I have never been to a place where the soda menu looked like a comprehensive beer guide. Each are or, rather, were served in standard mason jars, which certainly earns points for style. \n\nBeing a fan of lamb, I ordered the Morocco, which is topped with a caramelized onion chutney, feta, and arugula. My brother ordered the PB&J, which is includes arugula pesto, bison patty, house tomato jam, goat cheese, and arugula. For our fries, I got the Wasabi Ketchup and he got the Rooster sauce, both of which were amazing when combined with incredible fries. As for the burgers, ours were cooked properly to our very different specs (I do not believe burgers should have pink and he enjoys a little pink). The burgers were juicy and flavorful on their own and the inclusion of the other elements put them both over the top. \n\nAfter finishing our lunch, I order shakes to go for the two of us and our mom and step-dad. While I enjoyed the new experience of a spicy pepper chocolate shake (sweet with a sting in the back of the throat), I will probably find a more traditional flavor or less assaulting. The shakes were done well, though. \n\nI will admit that I was concerned going in the first time after reading a disappointing review in Sauce Magazine, but whatever problems existed during their reviews were not present. I heard that Bailey's Range underwent staff changes after the review and, if this is the case, they did something very right. All in all, I can count two people who hold this restaurant with very high regards.","stars":5}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Pros: \nI love the idea of Local Harvest! Supporting a local business, buying local produce and meats, and having a variety of vegetarian and vegan options are all awesome, cool things that I support. \n\nAlso, they have a free seed library! They have it organized by what kinds of plants you're trying to grow as well as the level of experience required to successfully grow it. There are instructions on how to harvest seeds from what you do plant so that you can give back to the seed library and keep it going. \n\nThe beer and especially the wine selection quite large, considering the tiny size of the store. The alcohol section takes up probably a good quarter of the store! \n\nCons: \nHowever, I just can't make it my main grocery store because it's on the pricey side and the selection is pretty limited. \n\nOverall, though, what small selection they do have is fresh and local, so if you're willing to pay a higher price, go ahead and do it! You won't regret it!","stars":3}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"This review is over a year in the making. The only reason I gave a second star is that I was impressed with the vet techs and the woman at the front desk. Last April, I took my 8 month old kitten here after she had trouble keeping food down for a few days. They gave her an X-ray and said that they saw a \"fuzzy spot\" and that it could possibly be a foreign body she swallowed. They wanted to keep her overnight ($$$) but I said I'd rather bring her home. They gave her anti-nausea medication and said \"bring her in tomorrow. If she still can't keep food down, that means there's definitely something in there and she needs surgery.\"  I came in the next day and told the vet that not only had she eaten some, but she kept it down! The vet then told me that that doesn't necessarily mean anything, and that she didn't feel comfortable having me bring her home because she could die. In my most vulnerable state, I agreed to the surgery. ($$$)\n\nAfter the surgery, the vet called and said they didn't find anything in her stomach, but her organs looked \"weird\" so they sent about 7 samples off for biopsy ($$$). A couple weeks later, the vet called and told me Marley had FIP and that she likely had months to live. She told me FIP is always fatal but I could give Marley meds to manage the pain. She had already called an animal pharmacist so that I could easily purchase the meds ($$$). \n\nNearly $3,000 later, I had Marley home. I had never heard of FIP so I did my research. I found out there is no way to perfectly test for the disease, there are a lot of false positives and vice versa. But cats with FIP tend to be low-energy and not eat very much. Over those last couple weeks, Marley seemed back to normal. She was eating a ton, and sprinting all over the house. I was starting to thinking this was a misdiagnosis. I took her to different vet and he said \"I don't understand. This looks like a perfectly healthy cat to me.\" I called the Humane Society, who sees everything, and they said based on how I was describing her, it was highly unlikely she had FIP.\n\nWhen I took Marley back to Noah's for her incision recheck, the vet could not believe that I hadn't gotten the pain meds ($$$). I told her I didn't think she had FIP and she looked at me like I was crazy. She said \"I can't pinky promise she has it, but I am 99.9% sure.\" She continued to push the pain meds. (I never got them).\n\nI AM HAPPY TO REPORT that over a year later, Marley is still high energy, eats like a glutton, and has not shown signs of being sick since the surgery. Needless to say, I have a new vet.","stars":2}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch in this restaurant located on the end of a mini strip mall along US 36, just west of Ronald Reagan Dr.  Plenty of free parking in the lot outside this shotgun set up restaurant.  \n\nWe were seated promptly and had good service throughout the meal.  We had very small wait times between courses, the table was cleared quickly and water refilled.  The service was really good and kept the rating from going into the negative zone.\n\nSome of the food was really good.  Although they use imitation crab, the crab rangoon which came with a crushed peanut dipping sauce was the best I have had!  It was filled with a generous amount cream cheese and a blend of flavors that made for a great start to our meal.  \n\nThe edamame, however, was a little under cooked and needed a bit of work for the beans to \"pop\" from the shell.  They were also salted heavily on the top, but not much on the pods lower in the bowl.  \n\nMy wife's Thai Dumpling were made from ground chicken and shrimp which were on the bland side when compared to the flavorful pork options I have had elsewhere.  The Ginger Soy Sauce that accompanied the dumplings was a thick sauce that helped, but my wife is not a big fan of ginger, so she wasn't thrilled with the selection.\n\nThe soup course (clear chicken noodle for her, Miso for me) was okay.  Since I ordered a Bento Box for lunch, my soup and a salad selection came with the Box.  I ordered a Mixed Seaweed Salad which was more salad greens than I have had elsewhere that features the seaweed in a thread like prep.  The seaweed here was in thin ribbons atop the field greens and dowsed in a salty soy and ginger dressing.  Can't recommend this.\n\nThe Bento Box came with a choice of about a half dozen sushi rolls (8 pcs), Seafood Tempura (4 pcs), and a choice of a sashimi or nigiri option.  I went with the really good \"Philly Roll\" with cream cheese, avocado, seaweed, and a choice of meat (I chose eel) wrapped in a sushi rice.  Very creamy and tasty!  The seafood tempura had two pieces of breaded shrimp and calamari that had a rather bland coating.  I went with the Salmon Sake Sashimi which came with three pieces of salmon served on what I think was chilled radish threads.  The salmon was fine, just not on the same level of what I have had at my favorite places.\n\nThis is a nice place and I have not had a chance to try the Thai side of the menu.  However, when it comes to sushi, I cannot recommend this as my first choice.\n\nReview #306","stars":3}

I mean, maybe it was the awesome weather that day or the fact that even though we waited for a table for over a half an hour it didn't feel like we had waited at all, but I also had high expectations for this place. After hearing rave reviews and scanning the menu online on several occasions, it was finally time.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I was in the market for a new backpack and I've heard great things about the quality of the leather that they use in their products. A good friend of mine has dozens of Tumi products and swears by them. \nThat being said I wasn't crazy about spending hundreds of dollars on the backpack I wanted (London Roll Top) without knowing the quality myself. Being a underpaid college student, $600 is a lot for a backpack haha! \nSo I dipped my toes in the water and bought the $100 portfolio phone case for my XS Max. \nFast forward 1 week, the leather was already horribly distressed and they replaced it for free, great! Awesome customer service, Ian was extraordinary!\nFast forward another about month\/month and a half later and again the leather is again horribly distressed, not what you expect out of leather as it ages and gets broken in. And the plastic frame that holds your phone in place inside is broken. \nI get phone cases are used rigorously daily and are subject to high levels of wear and tear but for less than 2 months this is kind of ridiculous to me.\nWhen I spoke to a sales associate, I believe her name was Olivia (??), but I don't entirely remember, about my dissatisfaction with the product she gave me the boilerplate response that I just mentioned... \"well phone cases do wear out more\" so on and so forth. However, the response that I found most shocking of a company of their quality, or perceived quality was \"well the phone cases are contracted out and we don't directly oversee the quality control process\"... So you put your name on a product that you don't properly vet. That's interesting... I also heard from someone that worked there that this wasn't the first time they've had issues with the quality of the phone cases...\nThey offered me store credit to return my phone since it wasn't \"re-sellable\" I thought that was laughable, you can't even guarantee the quality of the products that in my mind should be simplest to guarantee. I'm sure, since I was assured that the leather and craftsmanship is contracted out, this isn't representative of the workmanship of the company as a whole. \nHowever, to leave me on the hook for something that you sell being sub-par is interesting to say the least...\nNot to mention before this phone case I had a similar authentic Italian leather case from Apple that cost $40 and held up significantly better than this has. \nI'm not saying I'll never shop with them again, I'm not that type of person, however right now I have a bad taste in my mouth with the company and I can find arguably comparable products for $10 and less on Amazon or Wish that last substantially longer if I wanted. \nI'm also not one of those jerks that would say avoid them at all cost.. The initial customer service experience I had was wonderful and I hope they get that sorted out.","stars":2}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Where to start....We chose SqWires as our rehearsal dinner venue, and worked with Jill during the planning process. I was clear from the beginning that I cannot have Gluten due to having Celiac Disease and was assured that would not be a problem. We scheduled a tasting, and upon arriving and was told by AJ that everything was gluten free, only for them to bring out Orzo as a side.... which is 100% not gluten free. I over looked this, and we continued with the process. We were told we would meet with Jill at the tasting to discuss details, and she had overbooked herself and was off the premises for a meeting during our tasting time. 4 weeks before our event I sent my final head count (3 less than our original estimate), it took 2 weeks for Jill to get back to me and when she did she informed me we did not meet the minimum, and gave no guidance on what to do next--leaving me panicking 2 weeks before the event. This led to a long discussion with Beth and Jill where their solution was that we pay half of the difference in order to have the consumption bar we planned (and then we would pay the bar bill at the end). Finally we agreed (1 week before the event) to just add a per person bar package to meet to minimum. (Make sure you ask plenty of question regarding what does and does not count toward the minimum). Fast forward to the day of the rehearsal. I again double checked that everything was gluten free, and was told that one of the entrees actually was not (which was also served to me at the tasting and at that time I was told it was gluten free). They did offer to make me something else, but at that point I was frustrated by the whole situation and just ate the other things we chose for the buffet. It is unacceptable to have so much confusion when it comes to dietary restrictions and allergies (I could have ended up very sick on our wedding day had I eaten the chicken--thinking it was gluten free since I was told previously it was). Overall for a venue that does events quite often I was disappointed and frustrated with the lack of communication, professionalism, and attention to details and requests. I would not recommend this venue.","stars":1}

They have a ton of outdoor seating available and the lay out breaks the large restaurant into smaller sections to create a more intimate dining experience. I ordered the Summer Fizz cocktail while we waited 20 minutes for our table and it was very tasty but small for $10. We ordered the brussel sprouts as an appetizer and they were delicious! I love when brussel sprouts are slightly charred. I ordered the cheese empanadas and they were good but I wish I would've chosen one with meat. My boyfriend ordered the skirt steak and loved it.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Bikeshare is awesome.   I only get a half hour for lunch so walking distance has limited my radius.    I took my 1st bikeshare ride today to go early vote at the City-County Building.   The walk alone would have taken me at least 20 minutes.   However, I was able to sign up for a one-day pass at a kiosk, undock a bike, and ride to the dock right in front of the City-County Building in 10 minutes.   All without even breaking a sweat.   (Note: I had a promo code for a free 1-day pass so I paid nothing.   All I needed was a credit card to swipe at the kiosk.)\n\nThere are some killer features on the bike itself.   The integrated bell is a must for warning pedestrians on the Cultural Trail.   There's an integrated cable lock, but I don't really see myself using it very much.   There are docks all over downtown, so why not just dock it and not worry about exceeding the 30-minute time limit.   The only occasion where I could see myself using the lock is if I was just running in a restaurant for take-out (the bike has a front basket and a rear basket for hauling stuff) and there were no docks within sight.   There's also a kickstand.\n\nThe B-Cycle app shows all the docking stations (including # of available bikes and # of open docks) on an interactive map.   If you don't have a smartphone, then there is a convenient map of downtown (showing the docking stations) right on the bike.\n\nThe bike itself is a tank.   It's meant to withstand the elements as well as people who haven't ridden a bike in 30 years.   Don't expect to break any speed records on this thing.   But it's smooth as all get out (probably because they're brand new).   It has a 3-speed grip shift for convenience.   Hopefully the maintenance staff keeps these bikes in good working order.\n\nAs you ride through downtown, expect a lot of looks and people coming up to you asking about bikeshare or the bike (as it is quite an eye-catcher in bright gold).\n\nThe only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star review is the cost.   It's $8 per day which is about the cost of a cab ride to anywhere downtown.   The annual pass is $80 which is a little steep.  The Chicago and Washington DC bikeshare systems are just $75 per year.  The Citi Bike bikeshare system in NYC is $95 per year (that's a great bargain considering the cost-of-living).   The Nashville bikeshare (using the same system as Indianapolis - B-Cycle) is just $50 per year.   The Madison, WI bikeshare (also B-Cycle) is $65 per year.","stars":4}

I'm just not sure if it's worth $17, but it's good. \n\nEven with an appetizer, entree, and two beers, my friend and I both had enough room for fro-yo after. \n\nBottom line:\n- come for the beer!

The garlic knots, as noted in other reviews, are great, but can sometimes be a little slow on getting more (I realize this is because they make them fresh, but sometimes it feels like your table is forgotten about if you sit in the side patio section).\n\nI like the house salad a lot, and that's usually what I get as my entree.  Most other things I just don't like enough to justify spending $20 or so on to order.  So sometimes eating here is a little boring for me, but I at least know I can always count on it to be a nice upscale-casual type of place.  \n\nReally, it is a good, consistently solid place with rotating seasonal options for appetizers or specials.

However, the service is not great, the servers aren't all that friendly, and they add 20 percent gratuity onto tables of 6 or more... Yet this is not advertised on the menu and they don't otherwise alert you to this until you see it on the bill. I think that's excessive, as adding 18 percent is what I consider customary.

Simplicity - simple menu with simple options, but just enough as to not overwhelm its visitors. You can order two entrees and a couple of other items and really grasp an idea of the variety and boldness of the flavors throughout the menu\n3. Uniqueness - Not the typical Thai menu. It stresses its Thai background, with a little Japanese on the side. We especially enjoyed the Naam Prik Nuum (veggies with a spicy hot sauces) .  \n4.

The decor is nice, and the place was cozy and inviting (especially when they lowered the lights). The live jazz guitar was GREAT. \n\nThe not so good.. it was empty on a Friday evening. We saw only one other table come in over the at least 1.5 hours we were there. The wine didn't taste particularly fresh (more acidic than it should have been). There was sediment in one of our wines; when we mentioned it, the employee poured us new glasses from the same bottle, which came out clean. This means that the lines running from the bottles were dirty, which kind of sketched us out. The included \"cheese plate\" (which is on the menu for $15) primarily included pre-packaged deli slices of cheese.

Obviously not a real complaint, though getting a spoon along with it would have been nice. \n\nThe milkshakes are appropriately sized for the prices paid ($6-$8). Thought I didn't spend the $3 extra to get alcohol added to mine, I did consider it... I also really liked that it was a true milkshake that could be easily consumed through a straw (except the previously mentioned chunks). Too many times I'll get a milkshake and it's too thick to drink out of the straw right away. There were many regular and fancier flavors of milkshakes on the menu as well as other ice cream treats.

There was 6 of us and we were starving. We ordered a large pizza with cheese and bacon for the kids and Homemade chicken salad sandwiches and wings for us. We got the wings pretty fast but the kids sat there waiting for their pizza. An hour later! Seriously? An hour later they got their disgusting burnt pizza! Our sandwiches were ok.

I asked the manager  to check on the pizza to see what the delay was and just as she approached the kitchen doors, the food was coming out. She never acknowledged me after that. It did not surprise me when the so called \"manager\" did not come to our table to apologize or to just check on us. Very poor customer service. After the waitress brought our check, I asked her if she can tell me why it took an hour to get a burnt pizza, she tried to make something up instead of just apologizing like \"there was 2 or 3 other pizza orders ahead of yours and our oven only fits one pizza at a tIme\". Wow, good try! A simple apology would have been better. We didn't say anything about the pizza being burnt because the kids were crabby and starving. They just ate it. Worse pizza ever!

We had Teriyaki. Pretty good.\n\nNext came the main dish. I had the corn beef and cabbage while my wife had a hamburger. Mine was excellent, didn't have potatoes in it, but it did have red pepper. Was good. My wife said her hamburger was as good as FIVE GUYS.\n\nOh and lets not forget the very friendly staff!\n\nSo what's the deal? Why the bad previous reviews on previous reviews? \n\nThey admitted that they had gotten rid of several people. Also, the new cook was only at the place a little while.

I've eaten here twice and this restaurant is great for vegetarians and vegans. The inside is very small with limited seating therefore there can be a wait. For brunch I had the Vegan Biscuits and Gravy. I'm not a vegan but wanted to try something different! I was happy with my order, the gravy had a very interesting curry flavor and the vegetables on top added extra flavor (I can't remember what the veggies were now though). I wondered, before ordering, \"How can gravy possibly be good without animal products?\" but I was blown away! I also sampled my friends order of the regular B\/G which were very good as well! When I came for dinner, I was in a big group. We split the Corn Fritters, I def recommend them. I had the Buffalo tempeh - another adventurous choice but again very delicious! These cooks know what they're doing! I did try the chai and was not impressed. My waitress for dinner was flaky and kept forgetting things, serving the wrong beer for dinner, didn't write anything down, and it took a while for us to finish and actually check out. Overall, given the concept of Farm to Table and the food, I would come back again.","stars":3}

Southern wins by a landslide.\n\nI love that you can choose from different levels of heat for your chicken. I went for hot, and I usually like a lot of heat, but it was borderline being too hot. I'll definitely get it hot again next time ha, but fair warning to those out there, consider trying the level down from that for your first time if you like heat but not a ton of it. \n\nTheir chicken was crispy but super juicy. Their mac and cheese was spot on with a balance of pasta, cheese, and bread crumbs. Really impressed with it and I usually don't love mac and cheese. Collared greens were okay, but I might not like collared greens personally, which could have been the problem. I've actually never tried them until now! Definitely buy a biscuit and split it with someone. Buttery, flaky, and a perfection addition to the chicken.","stars":5}

I arrived late at night and had no problem checking in immediately, which was a plus. However, during the early morning hours the water was completely shut off. I didn't raise the issue with management on the first night, but when it was still off on the second night I called the front desk to complain. The person I spoke with didn't seem surprised by the problem and offered the following solution: to switch rooms. It was about 2:30am. Obviously we didn't go this route. \n\nThe following day I spoke with the front desk manager and she comped our 2 nights, which I felt was the right thing to do. We return home, and I see on my credit card statement that we were charged for 2 nights with the valet at $44 a night. We only used the valet one night. So I called to have this charge reversed, which they did promptly. \n\nOverall, without these issues, I would give this Westin 5 stars. However the problems we did experience made our stay less than stellar.","stars":3}

I LOVE it when things go perfectly, the food tastes great, the order is right, etc.  You get the point, but what happens when things go wrong?\n\nI've often found that the best of times and the worst of times reveal people's true character, and I feel it's the same for businesses.\n\nRecently my wife went into McAlisters, and she ordered dinner.  It didn't come out right. :(  She had to have them remake it.  They did, and she headed back home.  She got home and it was wrong. She admitted that she should have double checked it again, but she didn't.\n\nI reached out to McAlister's GM and found out she was out of town, so I contacted a manager I had dealt with previously, and he apologized and helped me connect with the McAlister's team.  They were apologetic, and kind.  They took steps to make the situation right, and they went above and beyond.  You could tell they were sincerely sorry and were very genuine in their apology and in their efforts to make things right.\n\nAgain, I love it when it all works out, but I LOVE it when it doesn't and a team steps up and fixes it and restores that trust with their customer.

The pork chop was cold and tough and had no flavor, I thought maybe this was because we brought it home so I kept an open mind and said I would go back. \n\nJust went back to the block tonight and had a pulled pork sandwich... the pork itself was good and a lot was on the bun, which I like! However, the pork had a weird flavor  , something just did't taste right. The fries were great!, the slaw was not creamy like I like it. My friend and I were not satisfied with our dinner (she had the steak sandwich and didn't like it) so we decided to get dessert.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Hops & Fire is a great place to come if you have dietary restrictions: they have a super extensive vegetarian menu with lots of vegan options, as well as a really large gluten-free menu.  They've got a great craft beer list too, and the location is very convenient: when you don't feel like the hassle of going out downtown, having good food and beer in a strip mall in Greenwood with a huge parking lot is pretty appealing.\n\nMy sister (who has celiac disease) was able to eat onion rings here -- all of their breading is GF, and there's no cross contamination with oil in the fryer.  I tried a pretty good tofu steak crusted with pistachios, with a nice salad and some good mac n cheese on the side.  The veggie burgers look great, and I'd try them in the future.  Prices are pretty reasonable, and most entrees are in the $10 - $15 range.\n\nOne big drawback: the weeknight we visited they had live music playing that was so loud, you couldn't make conversation (or even hear yourself think.)  The music reverberated through the entire restaurant.  Unless listening to really loud cover bands is your jam, I'd visit earlier in the day call ahead to see if there's music or an open mic night on the schedule.","stars":4}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I want to start off by saying this brewery has a lot of potential and the beer is great! The location is prime and within walking distance of Mass Ave. I went with a large party and everyone enjoyed the different beers and drinks. Their beverage selections is where it should be. \n\nI understand that I went with a large group after it had only been open for a couple of weeks, so I'm hoping after some time they will work out most of the kinks. \nLet me break it down:\n\nFood:\nFrom a consensus of about 20 people the good options are the Jalapeno appetizers and the Mahi tacos. The hamburgers kept coming out burnt on both side after asking for them medium-rare. Even after being sent back they were still burnt. The chicken avocado sandwich isn't anything to write home about, but it is edible.\n\nService:\nThe staff seemed very unhappy (at least on the patio). My theory is that the church is actually haunted and a demon\/ death eater is sucking out the souls of the employees. I didn't see a server crack a smile even once!It took about 20 minutes to get a new beer and all of the checks were wrong in the end. I understand it was a large group and its a new place. The bathroom didn't have any toilet paper in the stalls and the trash had been taken out of the can, but no one decided to remove it from the bathroom. When I walked into the bathroom there were two employees, one was washing her hands and the other was one the phone. Between the two of them surely they noticed these things. \n\nOverall: I would give it a couple weeks to get acclimated before you try it. The beer is great and it has the potential to be a fun and lively place. I love the concept and I hope they review some of the menu items and work on the cooking and serving.","stars":2}

Our wait staff were great, the food was good (best \"Bob Cobb\" salad I've had in a long time), but it was exceptionally noisy and difficult to hear the other 7 people at our table.  The high ceilings made it seem louder than it was.  \n\nThis evening also happened to be when the Blues were playing in the Western Conference finals. There were a couple of TV's showing the game. Our group and the other large group in the open area were watching the game and cheering and enjoying ourselves. The manager came over in the middle of the game and changed the channel to a basketball game. We complained and asked him to change it back. He said \"can't you see the other TV?\" (Situated at the complete other end of the dining area, so no, it was too far away). My husband is blind and relies on verbal commentary. He just turned around and walked away.  So we asked a waitress if we could get the game back on again and we were told that they were not allowed to use the remotes.  We will not be going back, which is unfortunate because the food was good. The management needs to relook at their customer service.

Everything was fine until 2 weeks ago when my husband and I discovered the digital display on the oven\/range wasn't displaying and wouldn't turn the oven on.  It beeped when we pushed a button, but that's it. So I made a claim. They wanted the home inspection report (something I've never had to give my other home warranties in the past), which I provided.  In the meantime they had told my husband on the phone a technician would be in contact. A technician has never called. Later he received an email saying the range was \"deferred\" because the home inspection said the oven was 15\u00b0 hotter than the [working] display at the time. My husband replied back asking how that had anything to do with the display no longer working and the oven not able to turn on. No reply for 10 days. Not having an oven has been a huge inconvenience for us. Especially since I'm pregnant. He reached out to them again today and again all they responded back with was the range was \"deferred\" due to the temperature difference from the inspection last April.

The Collinsville store is a newer yet smaller store, than either the Fairview or even the Edwardsville location. There is a fair amount of variety here however each of the departments gives up some selection for the smaller footprint.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"It's pretty bad when you enjoy visiting this type of place.......\n\nThe last thing you want to have to do is shell out your hard earned money to get your car fixed.  If it comes to that you can visit this place and know your vehicle needs it or they won't do it.\n\nI will admit that I am fortunate to know more about cars than the average woman.  That can be a good thing, or a dangerous thing depending on how the person you are talking to feels their level of knowledge is.  I don't pretend to know more than the mechanic, but I know enough to know if  they are trying to get over on me when it comes to repairs.   That will not happen when you talk to Mike or Scott...or honestly anyone of the guys in the garage.\n\nI drive a car that I really like because of the body style and I don't like the new ones, so mine gets treated like a member of the family and a baby at that.  First sign of a sickness I go to AutoLab.  Just ask them, they know me by name.  (Also I don't want to spend as much as a house to replace it).\n\nThe service is great, the prices are less than dealers charge, and if you stop in to ask them a question or take a quick look...they are there.  \n\nTwo days after Christmas, I stopped in to ask a question about no heat in my car..(I do live in the midwest and the polar vortex was about to attack us -- you want heat in your car).  I gave a brief description of what had happened the night before, and in moments I had Mike, Scott, Scooter, and 2 others under the hood of my car.  Twenty minutes later my car was blowing out heat like it was just off the showroom floor.   I had not had that many men or that much attention in ages, too bad  it was all for my car.  \nThat people is service, and it is  because you can trust this place and these people !  That is hard to find in the auto repair business.  I am a loyal customer who gets treated right in a place that is clean, pleasant to wait if you have too, and have a soft drink, coffee, television or wifi, all at their expense.  If you can't wait they arrange to take you home and pick you up when your car is ready. (within distance reason of course)\n\nDon't think they are some little place with not much business, they are anything but that.  Go in .... check them out....I promise you auto repair like this will have more people keeping their cars until they grow old.","stars":5}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I've eaten here twice now. The first time we had an average experience, food was okay, service was okay. The second time we came was a Wednesday night, we had a party of 4. They said they couldn't seat us at a table as we didn't have reservations and they didn't have any open tables for walk ins. This surprised me as there were quite a few open tables and it wasn't busy at all so I assumed we would be able to get a table on a Wednesday night but no big deal I understand the reservation thing. They said they could seat us at the bar which was fine with us. So we sat at the bar and got menus and all seemed well. Then about 10 mins later we hadn't even been acknowledged. Finally the bartender filled up our water glasses but didn't bother asking us if we were ready to order drinks. So about another 5 mins went by and I waved at the bartender to let her know we were ready to order drinks. She gave me an annoyed \"just a minute\" signal and then went to a couple next to us and got their drink order. This would have been fine except for the fact that this couple and just walked up meanwhile we had been waiting 15 minutes AT LEAST and hadn't even been offered anything other than water. She took their drink order, proceeded to make their drinks and taking her sweet time doing so. Finally she served them their drinks so I assumed she was going to come take our order, BUT she then went over to the computer and put their drinks into the computer and again took her sweet time doing so. Finally we just got up and left because it was so ridiculous. Waited 25 plus minutes and never even got to order drinks. I probably wont ever bother going back here because this experience was so bad. I'm not sure what this bartender had against us but I can guarantee she missed out on what would have been a large tip if she had given us adequate attention.","stars":1}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"We went to Luciano's Trattoria to celebrate our anniversary last night.   Business was quite slow - maybe 4 tables.   Based on our experience, it's not due to the food or service, but probably because everyone has tried it and moved on to the next new thing.  Hopefully things will pick up for them.   \n\nFood:  We started with the Fritto Misto appetizer, which had calamari, shrimp, asparagus and fennel, all breaded and fried.   It was an ugly pile, a little more oily and not as flavorful as I would have thought.  Not awful, but certainly not something I'd be anxious to try again.  For entrees, we had their Halibut and Lobster special and Vitello.  The special was wonderful.  As noted in some reviews we read, the chef has a way with seafood.   The fish was atop beans (navy, I think) in a brown, semi-sweet sauce that was very flavorful and included cinnamon and we couldn't figure out what else, although we were reminded of some Asian dishes we've had.   It was a very creative dish and a pretty good deal at $21.95.   The vitello was less good, but not great.  A few medallions of breaded and fried veal that was kind of bland.  It was served with arugula with shaved parmesan.  The arugula was pretty salty when eaten alone, but with the veal, the two came together very nicely, with the parmesan giving it an extra little kick.   Not sure if I'd get it again, but it was fine.  Overall, the prices seemed to be a couple dollars per item less than we could have expected.\n\nService:  Very good - we never had to touch our bottle of wine, food came out promptly and hot and our water was always topped off.   The ambience was nice.  I'd say this is a great place for a business dinner.  There was a guy hanging out by the bar in a windbreaker when we came in.  He wasn't drinking, so I figured he was waiting on a friend, but when we left he opened the door and thanked us, so I guess he was the owner?  One minor complaint was that the music seemed to be oriented toward the older crowd.  For a place with a pretty creative chef, I think they could be a little more current.  I also want to note they have a few tables in little alcoves that looked very nice.  They put us by the window, which was fine with us, but a much more elegant dining experience is possible, as well.     \n\nBottom line - pretty good food, good service, nice ambience and reasonable prices all come together to make Luciano's worth a try.","stars":4}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I want to give this place a higher rating because the building is so awesome, but I just can't.\n\nFirst, the good:\nThe indoor\/outdoor areas are great.   Plenty of seating, open and airy.   Very industrial and modern.   There's a large outdoor patio\/yard area on the side where food trucks can park and bands play.    Beers for on-site consumption are sold by the pint and run from $4 to $5.\n\nNow, the bad:\nThey only have 3 beers generally.   An IPA, a double IPA, and a seasonal.   Their signature beer is the Liftoff IPA.   You can find that all over Indianapolis.   The Rip Cord Double IPA is much harder to find.   And good luck trying to get your hands on the seasonal (today was the Vacation Kolsch) anywhere but the taproom.\n\nThe Liftoff IPA is a pretty standard IPA and is very drinkable.   The Double IPA was a little rough around the edges.   It's a shame because on Thursdays they tap a firkin with an experimental beer.   Today it was the Rip Cord finished with citra hops (and 1 other hop which I don't remember) and was much smoother than the Rip Cord.   The Vacation Kolsch is intended to be their summer drinking beer.   It is very flat and just reminds me of a your typical macro light beer.   Definitely a \"lawnmower beer\".\n\nThey can produce many more beers than they currently do due to the size of the production area.   They know this too as they are only using 4 of the 12 available taps.\n\nYou can sample any of the beers for free and either buy pints to drink there or to-go beer.   You can bring your growlers (more on that later) or half-growlers (aka bullets, howlers) in and have them filled with any of the house beers.   One neat thing they have that you don't see very often is the availability of crowlers (canned growlers).    They have a machine that will fill and seal a 32-oz can on site for ultimate freshness.   Of course it's not reusable.\n\nGrowler fills are $12 which is a little high for a house beer, but this is how they really screw you over:\n\nA little background: Indiana law says that anytime you refill a growler, it has to be labelled with the place you had it filled.   Most breweries consider this the cost of doing business and just slap their sticker on your growler, no problem.   However, at Daredevil, if you don't use one of their Daredevil-branded growlers (which they will be more than happy to sell you), they will charge you a $1 non-Daredevil growler sticker fee to slap their sticker on your growler.    I have been to dozens of microbreweries and this is the first time I've ever seen this.\n\nMain St in Speedway is growing like crazy and this is sure to be one of the anchor attractions.   I just wish Daredevil had better\/more beers and they didn't try to nickel and dime you along the way.","stars":2}

You couldn't use the Groupon for the buffet, only menu items. That was fine with me since I'll be returning ;)\n\nThere were two appetizers on the buffet. Potato slices deep fried (Veg. Pakora?) and Naan bread which is comparable to pita bread. The Naan was perfect, and the Pakora was good but a little too salty. \n\nThe rice wasn't too sticky or dry. I don't know if the goat is supposed to be that tough, but I gave up trying to consume it. The curries were so good! My favorite was the Chicken Tikki Masala which the owner said was their best selling dish. It was creamy, the chicken cubes were juicy, and just the right amount of spice. I liked the kidney beans and the spinach and cheese sides. The cheese was similar to tofu in texture and look but didn't taste like it at all. Apparently they make the cheese right in the restaurant. Gotta love it when a restaurant puts time into their food.\n\nNothing was overtly spicy or botched I thought. I wasn't to intrigued by their salad bar, chutneys, and desserts.

I ate here on Monday the 5th of January for dinner, and then ate my leftovers the next day during the lunch time hours. By the end of that evening I began to experience the symptoms. \n\nI'm sure it was a simple mistake, and is obviously not common given the good reviews.

When my wife and I first visited the dealership we test drove a few different models of Explorers and F-150s to get the feel of what we liked. Instead of pushing something we drove that was currently on their lot, Jim and Jason informed of a truck they just purchased at auction, but was not yet delivered. It seemed to have everything I wanted and then some. A week later, I returned and drove off the lot in a fantastic truck. Jim went above and beyond in the sales process as I requested to have my own mechanic inspect the truck before the deal closed. Jim personally took the truck to my mechanic on his day off. I would highly recommend Sunset Ford and Jim Wagstaff.","stars":5}

The pesto ravioli is so good, I now exclusively eat it when I come here (which makes sense since I come here when I want pesto). I've had a few issues with the pasta itself where it's a bit undercooked, but the pesto is so rich and smooth that it doesn't matter that much. \n\nThe restaurant itself is an old house that's been converted into a restaurant and the layout shows it. There's not one main dining area but a bunch of separate rooms each with only a few tables. This is nice because it keeps things quieter (unless you end up in a room with a particularly loud and rude family). They also have two nice outdoor eating areas, one is the main courtyard around back near the parking, the other lines the side of the building along the Monon bike trail. \n\nThe service here is fantastic. They're all very friendly and attentive. I've never had to actually ask for a refill on a drink (they just appear) and food\/bill arrival is always very prompt. Most recently they went above and beyond my expectations. Over a year ago they had a special, goat cheese filled ravioli with pesto, and every now and then I'll call to see what their specials are hoping for a reappearance. My wife called a couple weeks ago without me knowing to discuss bringing this meal back for a night for my birthday meal.

It's south of the metrolink line down Sarah (so not close to CWE) but north of the interstate (so not close to the Grove).  The suggested parking is across an intersection in what looks like a no-man's-land, and available street parking works for around ~9 cars (and that's for all BJC along with TH).

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Dear Chef Michael, \n\nI have an embarrassing confession. I had no idea who you were when I decided to visit your latest B Spot Burgers location in Indianapolis, one of eight locations for the world of burgers that you apparently dominate. I had no idea that your burgers had been voted America's best burger at the Sobe Burger Bash in 2010, 2011, 2012,  and 2014. \n\nI kind of wonder what happened in 2013. \n\nI'd never heard of your Fat Doug, Yo!, or Porky award winners. While I've heard of the James Beard Foundation Award, I sheepishly admit not knowing you'd won it. I'd heard your name, but had no idea you are ALL OVER the Food Channel. \n\nSo, I apologize. \n\nI'd heard that B Spot was your place, but for all I knew you were some rockin' local chef with a penchant for burgers. Gee whiz. You're pretty awesome. \n\nSo, I arrived at your new spot that opened in the last week or so with fairly high expectations. It's also set in the modestly high-end Ironwork alongside Ruth's Chris and Sangiovese. That's pretty amazing company.\n\nI was a little thrown off by the two rather haphazard accessible parking spots, one marked only by the pavement marking and the other a better but still non-ADA compliant spot. \n\nI arrived early in the dinner hour on a Wednesday and was seated fairly quickly at a 4-top very near the entrance. The staff were incredibly friendly, though I'd say they were slightly off in timing. Still, it wasn't a big deal. After I initially waited a few minutes for my server, once Malinda arrived she was terrific and had clearly learned her stuff about the restaurant, your food, and the differences between certain items. I was impressed. \n\nI wasn't completely thrown off by the whole \"ala carte\" thing - there are no sides with sandwiches with sandwiches ranging from a $7.99 basic burger to right around $10.99 for some of the specialty burgers. Sides include Lola Fries, shoestring fries with rosemary for $3.99 and others ranging from $2.99 - $8.99 in price. You have a few other sandwiches, but clearly specialize in burgers. That makes sense. You also serve a ton of beers and some awesome looking shakes, though for $5.99 and up I'd expect that shakin' to be topless. \n\nI was tempted by your award-winners, but for the first visit kept it basic with a cheeseburger, ordered mid-well, along with Lola fries and my usual unsweetened iced tea. The entire bill came in at just over $16. \n\nMichael. Can I call you that now? I have really wrestled with this review. \n\nI don't eat a lot of red meat anymore, but this burger was worth the splurge. It was thick, juicy, and the bun was absolutely delicious. The fries were also quite good. I enjoyed the iced tea and appreciated having a server who served up two refills so I could linger a bit. \n\nI love that your servers can process the credit card from the table - in this day and age, it's rather nice not having that card leave my sight. I hope this catches on. \n\nBut, I've got to be honest. There were a few problems that, at least I'm hoping, are slight kinks to be worked out. The parking concern is modest, though may become an issue during crowded times. I found the service a couple times to be a tad slow including the initial introductions and the initial wait once seated. \n\nThere was one fairly major faux pas. I was seated in a corner table - at the time not surrounded by people. As crowds arrived, the unfathomable choice to seat a party of five at a table near the main aisle was made. This not only blocked aisle access, but it also blocked my exit. I actually had to move my table, without help from your staff, in order to leave. That's inexcusable and, quite honestly, a pretty serious fire hazard (especially when your outside area is closed off). This also delayed my leaving - which can be important when people are waiting! I could also tell this 5-person party was uncomfortable and on more than one occasion had to move to allow someone through the aisle. If I noticed this, why didn't the staff? \n\nEssentially, the food and service were a 4-star experience for me on this visit. If I could go 3.5 overall, I would. However, my modest concerns added to this make me feel like I have to round the score down rather than up. My gut feeling? As the bugs work out, you'll have a solid 4-star experience and maybe even prove to be one of Indy's premier burger joints. \n\nGood service. Very good food. Average, industrial atmosphere with terrific outside options. Logistical issues. If your price point is going to be higher than most other burger joints in town, and it is, then you need to make sure the service and atmosphere match it. Tonight? It didn't. It was a good experience but, let's be honest Michael, you can do better. \n\nThanks for listening. \n\nRichard","stars":3}

We also got the tuna steak tacos which were fresh and made well just lacking a little kick, even with the yummy pico.  The owner came over to ask us how our meal was and how we had heard of them.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Let me start with the bad, because this is what is leading to this 2-star rating and a bad taste in my mouth.  The drink menu at Salt has many cocktails, Bourbons and Scotches.  One of the better values on the menu is a pour of Eagle Rare for $9, which I ordered \"Neat\" as I do at any restaurant. The food and service was impeccable, leading to an excellent dining experience, until we noticed our bill after paying for our meal. The Eagle Rare was listed on the itemized receipt as \"Add Neat\" for $12 each. After taking a second look at the menu to confirm the $9 price, I questioned the waitress about the difference. She told me there was an up charge for both \"Neat\" and \"On the Rocks\"and directed me to the bar manager across the restaurant. Most are going to order \"neat\" or \"on the rocks\" but at this establishment ordering \"Neat\" or \"on the rocks\" is some specialty.  A standard pour is 1.5 ounces. As a former bartender; no matter how it is ordered a pour is a pour is 1.5 ounces. According to the bar manager, at Salt a \"neat\" pour is 2 oz and they charge a price as such. So, the drink listed at $9 became a $12 drink.  This was not noted on the menu and was not mentioned by the waitress at time of order. While I paid for what I got (an extra 33%) this was not expected and is a deceiving practice. Had I been ordering a drink that was listed at $45 a pour, which I do a few times a month, that would have unexpectedly shown up as $60 on my tab.  \n\nThe food was fresh and delicious and the table service was attentive and polite. I'll even order another drink, but I will be sure to account for the odd up-charge policy. That being said, it is still completely out of the ordinary and I cannot imagine I am the only one who has been caught off guard.","stars":3}

The front desk worker said \"The guys are real sticklers about it and actually prefer 2:45 to be the last wash time.\"  We explained we were new to town and needed to wash our dogs and would be quick and the front desk worker said \"No, I'm sorry.\"  Any small business that would turn away new customers with 2 dogs 54 min before they close is not customer friendly and obviously won't take 6 min of their time to help out a customer. Very disappointed! Not what I expected - most businesses in Edwardsville are very friendly and welcoming. Not this one :(","stars":1}

I had the Traditional breakfast; eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast.  Everything was cooked perfectly and was yummy!  I went crazy over the toast!  It's like a hearty grain, cut thick and toasts up deliciously!  I'm not a jam fan, but I tried just a bit of their house made jam and ended up eating all of it...it was that good!  The breakfast potatoes are the best I've ever had!  They are thick cubed and cooked well so you get bits of crunchy yummies!  Server was friendly behind her mask and took great care of us.  I love the open, bright sunshine filled room.  The atmosphere is pleasant, with that...take it easy vibe.  I love this place!","stars":5}

I switch up my order every visit, but there are of course some items on the menu which are a must have! As we all know I am a Mac and Cheese fan and so I always recommend this as it is delicious. I am addicted to the Chicken Frontega when it is cold outside bc it is warm and filling. During the summer months the salads are always a hit. As for drinks, that all depends on my mood and the weather. Again, I switch it up all the time. Chai Tea Lattes are a great choice and during the fall season you can get the Pumpkin Latte which is quite yummy! Oh, and did I mention I have this amazing Panera rewards card? Well I do! I swipe it every time I order and it seems like I almost always get a free bagel or pastry after just 2 or 3 purchases! Free bagels and pastries?!?!? Of course I love free stuff.","stars":4}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I was in town for business and searched yelp to get a suggestion of a restaurant in the St. Louis area to celebrate my birthday near our hotel and found Atlas. I am so glad that i did. It was a great experience the entire evening.\n\nOur waitress was very attentive. We were undecided on some wine choices, so our waitress made some suggestions and then brought us tastings to make sure we would be satisfied. \n\nWe started off the night with the eggplant appetizer and couldn't have made a better choice. For our main dishes, I chose the steak and fries, which I can honestly say was one of the best steaks I have had! One friend chose the salmon(which was the special) and thankfully, she shared it. It was delicious. I live in Seattle and was very pleased with this salmon. My other friend chose the spinach ravioli with mushrooms and again I was lucky enough that she shared. Each main course was outstanding. Both in taste and value.\n\nFinally, since it was my birthday, I wanted dessert. I ordered the chocolate cake, but really wanted the raspberry sorbet. I let my waitress know it was a difficult choice, so she replaced the vanilla ice cream that came with my cake with the sorbet. She just kept going the extra mile. My friends shared the tart, which was also good. \n\nI would go here again and highly recommend it!","stars":5}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"So, I'd like to preface this review with we don't keep red meat in the house. But, we made a flank steak yesterday on a whim and it's left an aftershock of red meat desires. \n\nSo, doing what any normal carnivore would, I decided to get a burger for lunch. Punch burger is right down the block from where I work so I'm instantly giving it a star for convenience. I walked in and the restaurant was clean and the service friendly, another star. I decide to be basic and order the Punch Cheeseburger. I was asked if I wanted it well done or a little pink; the red meat loving devil on my shoulder told me to choose the latter. I ordered a basket of waffle fries, intending to share them with some folks in the office. I paid, used a cool little tablet to sign, and was told my order would be up soon. Another star for quick service and pleasant staff. \n\nI get to my desk to eat and am slobbering at the thought of that delicious burger. I take one bite and its veggie! Rabbit food! I was heartbroken. Minus one star, Punch Burger. I called up and the gentleman told me he was sorry and he would get another one for me right away. He even offered to bring it to me since I was just down the block. Okay...you got your star back! When my new burger arrived it was accompanied by yet another basket of fries. Plus one star for the thanksgiving feast of waffle fries!!\n\nAll in all, punch burger earned one more star for the quality of their food. The fries were delicious and the burger hit just the right spot. So, hats off to you Punch Burger. You've earned one of my coveted 5 star reviews :)","stars":5}

I was kind of confused by this statement considering they're a breakfast place, but he was right. I took a sip of it and it was the worst iced coffee I think I've ever had--I couldn't drink it, and this was after I put cream and sugar in it.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Sean's family made reservations here for my early birthday celebration. I was excited since these places are usually a lot of fun. We had high hopes and while this place wasn't awful, we were definitely expecting more. \n\nThe place had a loung-y feel to it. The layout is good with some private areas to reserve up on a balcony above. The drink list was mostly fruity stuff and flirty girl 'shots'. I tried a couple. They tasted ok but weren't very boozy - expected with these types of shots so whatevs. \n\nThe crowd was varied and there were a decent number of people here by 9pm. Large groups for birthday parties and\/or bachelorette parties were the order of the day. Our reserved table was in a good spot to see the action but a huge group of soccer moms\/dads (not sure of the occasion for them) was put right next to us and they spilled over and blocked our view a lot of the time. \n\nThey open at 6 but the music doesn't start until 8:30. Huh? The name of the place is Jive and Wail and nothing is going on until 2.5 hrs after you open? Also, there is a $5 cover. Not a lot of money, but we ought to be entertained for the 30 bucks we spent collectively to walk into the place. I agree 6 is a little early to start a show - why not open later rather than have 4 people in there from 6 til 9?\n\nThe music - not so much. The talent of the piano-men was questionable. Most of the songs sounded not much like the song they were trying to cover and while their voices were decent, their piano skills were not. Also, we were incredulous to the types of songs they were choosing to play. Not your sing-along, get people involved in the show type of stuff. Weird, obscure songs that the piano guy might like, but that nobody knows the words to is not going to give you the kind of participation you're looking for. \n\nGlad we gave it a try and a nice idea for a birthday but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for this place again. It's probably a fun place to stop in for a beer at the end of a night out rather than someplace to spend the whole evening.","stars":2}

A friend and I ordered the poutine and two cheeseburgers; each item was $7 and was the perfect amount for two people. The poutine is insanely delcious and one of the more traditional iterations of the dish. Their fries are topped with gravy, pulled pork, FRIED cheese curds, jalapenos, pickled onions, and a fried egg.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Due to a rough yesterday and testing and X-rays today, I appreciated my brothers invitation to go out for pizza. Our only issue was deciding where to go. I recommended the Ale as we have lovingly called it for many, many years.  Several of us would go there after work when it was on 86th st. It was more personable then in my opinion. Since they moved here it's much bigger and the waiters and waitresses are running around like crazy.  We ate outside and it was so loud with people talking that it was extremely difficult for us to talk to one another.  Now, how was the pizza? Let me just say it was; SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS! We ordered one large, thin crust, deluxe and one small, thin crust, pepperoni. One thing I can't understand, (being in a powerchair), if you go inside, all of the tables are the very high pub tables with the very high pub chairs. How does that accommodate anyone like me?? I couldn't get on one of those pub stools no matter how hard I tried. There were empty tables inside, however we had to wait for seating outside thanks to impossible seating for me inside. I can't speak on the other food, but I can highly recommend the pizza. The thin crust crust is slightly crispy and holds up well under whatever toppings you put on. They put on real cheese here!!

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Tried the Primanti Bros. in Noblesville a few months ago and was not impressed with the food taste at all. Yesterday a friend asked me to go to the downtown location to try their wings. Sat at the bar it took a while to get a drink order placed. My glass was dirty and when I asked for another the bartender just placed it back with the other glasses before giving me a new one (she looked annoyed at my request). The beer was not ice cold just slightly colder than room temperature which makes beer not taste good. Finally order the wings and they were DISGUSTING.

I placed my order online through the app. The menu changes weekly which I like because it offers variety and gives you time to try items. This particular week Dirt Cake, Banana Cream Pie, Milk Chocolate Chip appealed to me. Sugar Cookie was sold out although it is regularly offered each week along with Milk Chocolate Chip. They also offered a peanut butter cookie to round out the rotation, but PB isn't my thing. My cookies were done ahead of their scheduled time despite having a small line including people waiting outside to come in. The cookies were so large and rich; I could only eat one at a time.

Each person in your party even gets their OWN salsa cup. This is the first place I have ever seen do this and it is brilliant. That is worth 5 stars alone.  Not to mention, it is VERY tasty and has the perfect flare to it! Sometimes, we come here just for margaritas (see below) JUST so we can enjoy the chips and salsa (shhhhhh). \n\n2. Frozen Margaritas!

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I am not sure what is happening here and it saddens me. I have been eating here for a few years and have never had any complaints.  A few months ago, the entire staff at the Carmel location changed. I am not sure what happened to the old staff but I miss them dearly. They were very friendly, quick and knew exactly what they were doing. \n\nSince then, service has been ridiculously slow. They still have no idea what items go on each salad and have to refer to the menu board for EACH salad that they make. I honestly think the product quality has gone way down also. Several times I have received lettuce that was either browning, not crisp or too hard because it was part of the core. I have received a salad with the wrong toppings or they completely leave off a topping that is supposed to come on the salad. I have also had more overcooked, chewy chicken on my salads since this new team took over. Typically you get a piece of bread with your salad and in the past it has been some sort of yummy wheat or multi grain. The last time I was there I got a piece of boring, white Wonderbread. Yuck! I even find that my dressings don't taste the same as they used to. Hmmm, new food vendor perhaps? They are also constantly out of items whether it be the regular to-go salad containers or red onions. \n\nI used to come here on a weekly basis and I find myself eating here less and less. But for $8-$10 I am not going to pay for wilted lettuce, slow service and incorrect orders. Sorry When Eddie Met Salad, I am done with you until you get your act together!","stars":1}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"First off, try their cocktails. The bar staff earns their keep and then some with their robust daily set and seasonal takes on old classics. I tried 4 very different types of drinks and each offered a unique, delicious experience. (5 Stars)\n\nNext, the food presentation is top notch. Tater tots: try them asap. With a rotating menu visitors' options will never go stale. I didn't have a real problem with any of the food I tried. However, while some food was amazing (scuttle fish, pierogi, rib eye), I'd avoid the crispy pork belly. I found it rather bland and not worth the price. (4 Stars)\n\nFinally, the layout is odd. The bar area is small but it works. The main dinner area with tables and booths is okay, but as an earlier reviewer stated, the ambience works best at dusk and night. Also, I'd avoid sitting near the bar against the windows if you're looking for an intimate dinner. I could barely hear anyone at my table even though it wasn't too crowded or noisy in the restaurant. Just odd acoustics, I guess. (3 Stars)\n\nOverall, go try the food and see if it's your scene. Definitely return for the drinks.","stars":4}

Placing the order online is the best way to go when possible but the prep doesn't take long at all when you order at counter. When ordering online they are occasionally faster than projection and have your order ready to go in a labeled bag in the carry out section. We love sharing the Korean Meatballs as a start. They even reheat well for the times our eyes are bigger than our stomachs. I love the Buffalo Mac with the Parmesan Chicken. Excellent flavor balance.

You're basically ordering your ice cream exactly how you want it. First, pick your size. Then your cream ( I chose custard but they have other options, even vegan). Then your flavor, and lastly, your mix ins. I for custard cream with strawberry flavor & cheesecake bites and brownies for my mix in. \n\nThe concept is really cool.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"First off, I love hibachi steakhouses.  It's probably my favorite style of food.  I used to go to this Benihana's often years ago, but stopped as I learned of better places around that are $5-15 less per entree on average (Sapporo and Izakaya come to mind).  Back then they were all similar quality, with the other two only slightly better in all respects.  Last night changed that, and showed me how much Benihana has fallen off over the years at every level but the hostess.\n\nOur server was very pleasant and was fast with refills, which was the only reason she still got a tip.  Our edamame was cold, but we ate it anyway.  We ordered another anyway, and soon saw a plate appear on top of the sushi bar.  Our server only had two tables at this point, our table of four and another table of two.  We ordered our food and she gave us a choice between soup or salad.  We asked her if we could have both (standard for any hibachi dinner), and she said sure.  When she returned, she was short a salad yet put soup and salad in front of me, leaving my friend with nothing until I pushed the salad across the table to him.  We finished our salads (which were warm and dry), and finally the server brought over the second plate of edamame, which was the same plate that had been sitting atop the sushi bar the last 15 minutes or so and was of course cold.  I ordered a cherry coke, and the server refilled my friend's regular coke from a pitcher.  She then refilled mine from the same pitcher and told me as she was doing it \"I know you ordered cherry, but it'.\"  She did that the rest of the night.  I didn't know I ordered a diminishing cherry coke.\n\nWe get our entrees.  My wife spots an eyelash on her plate before the server finishes setting it down.  The server was great about it and took it immediately to be remade.  Our friends had their entrees, but no rice or dipping sauces.  I did not receive an entree.  She returns to tell us it was being remade, and we had to ask for sauces and rice.  She seemed flustered by this, but eventually returned with sauces and asked me what I had ordered.  She came back with my wife's food and told me the cook hadn't made mine at all yet.  She did at least bring me a bowl of rice at this point.  My wife's \"new\" plate had burnt veggies and dry steak and chicken.  It certainly appeared to be the same food, cooked more, but hopefully wasn't.  The meat looked like dried out fajita meat.  It was flavorless, and was not cooked in any type of sauce.  She ate about five bites and gave up.  Meanwhile, the cook came over and told us the server was the one who never put my order in, but that it would only take her \"three minutes\" to cook.  10 minutes later I had my entree, too.  About 45 minutes after I ordered it.\n\nMy entree was cooked very well and I enjoyed it.  It came out with a fresh bowl of rice as well, which looked dried out and over cooked so I didn't touch it.  Not once did a manager come over to talk to us, but we did see her talk to a couple at the bar.\n\nThe server brings our bills, and we're surprised that nothing was done to make amends for all the problems we had.  Our friends were also charged for an item they didn't order.  The server returned with the corrected bill and took our cards.  We asked if we got tea or dessert, and she said I think one of you ordered off the six course, so yeah I can bring that out.\"  We all ordered six course meals.  We didn't see her for a solid fifteen minutes after that, which is when our patience finally ran out.  When she finally returned with ice cream and our friend's \"hot\" green tea, now cold of course, we asked for the manager.\n\nThe same manager we saw earlier avoiding us came over, and didn't seem too interested as we tried to tell her everything that went wrong.  She was very dismissive and borderline rude.  She 1\/4-heartedly apologized and told us she'd bring us some gift cards and left before we could stop her.  She returned with BOGO cards for us, and we told her we weren't interested, as we wouldn't be coming back.  We told her the rest of the issues and she apologized more genuinely, adding that she didn't know anything was going on.  I quipped that had she not failed to check on us at all, she would have known.  She begrudgingly agreed to take off my wife's entree, which was fair.  Our server pretty much made herself scarce at his point.  So with $10 tip, one entree and two soft drinks was still $59.  We routinely go to better hibachi places for $60ish for both of us.\n\nSo finally, after TWO HOURS of problems, we were almost ready to go.  I noticed another random plate of edamame waiting on the bar and started a stopwatch out of curiosity, not knowing how long it sat before I saw it.  It sat another three minutes before we walked out the door, still waiting to be delivered to a hungry table.  Part of me wishes I'd waited to see how long it took, but we'd had enough of their failures for the night.","stars":1}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"This review is long overdue, but Mission Taco on the loop has been the lifeline for my friends and I over the past two years. We live in the loft apartments right next door and we've been here for almost every Thursday Night Happy Hour since we moved in. The tacos are very delicious. Arguably they are pretty pricy with each taco ranging from $3.50-4, however happy hour cuts every taco to $2 which is pretty nice. Typically my friends and I will eat about 3-4 tacos per visit depending on how hungry we are. Our group favorites (in order) are the Hot Fried Chicken Taco, Shrimp Taco, Carne Asada Taco, and the Baja Grilled Fish Taco. Beyond tacos, the street corn is pretty stellar as well as the chips and guacamole. In terms of drinks, Pandora's Lunch Box is a sweet and tasty Pineapple Beer based drink, additionally the DTO is tart and sweet. I'd recommend any of these items. \n\nThe seating inside is pretty comfortable and on nice days they do seating outside--especially in the summer. \n\nThe service there has always been great and the waiters and waitresses are very attentive.\n\nOverall this place has been a nice spot for my friends and I to make memories over the years while we were at WashU and I would recommend it to anyone who's by the loop and wants to go somewhere with great food and chill vibes.","stars":5}

I had the Tallarines con Bistek Verdes which is basically a flat steak with a Pesto sauce and spaghetti noodles.

I was totally hooked after just a couple bites of each.  Then, as if gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches aren't enough pleasure for our tastebuds their true fame is The Grilled Cheese Donuts. Nine variations of well loved ingredients fill a sliced and grilled yeast donut prepared for old and new fans to devour. I'm looking forward to the \"Bananarama\", \"The Smore\" and \"The \"King\" Grilled Cheese Donuts. \n\nGLUTEN FREE & VEGAN OPTIONS are available for those of you thinking about passing on C-T's. The atmosphere is family oriented, lots of indoor tables with a separate counter view into the kitchen area to watch orders being prepared. Kids will find coloring books and crayons by beverage area.Orders are placed at the large menu chalk boards then delivered to your table. The Manager was very friendly, personable and informative while I was trying to decide on my selection. The Manager followed through by visiting customer tables for feedback on their experience.  I hope this practice continues since so many new restaurants stop following up after a few months of opening.\n\nI ordered the Armagoetta Grilled Cheese with Creamy Tomato Basil Soup and highly recommend both. The sandwich was delicious with a touch of crunchy from the fried onions and a wonderful blend of flavors with a slightly sweet & spicy kick from the spicy cherry peppers, sweet hot mustard and pepper jack cheese.\n\nYou have the option to build your own grilled cheese or select from the amazing selection of sandwiches on the LARGE menu board.   Carnivores can build around roasted beef, chicken or turkey roasted by C-T. Need more meat? Add your choice of pepperoni, bacon, ham or goetta to any sandwich. Goetta is a breakfast sausage popular in Cincinnati. If you crave serious cheese add Mac & Cheese to push your sandwich over the top. If cheese isn't an option for you build your own sandwich around your taste and dietary requirements. \n\nMy homemade Creamy Tomato Basil Soup was so satifying with excellent creamy texture and flavors. I enjoyed the tini chunks of tomatoes and basil while being creamy without the fresh basil overpowering the flavors.  My personal suggestion is GO FOR THE LARGE BOWL OF SOUP! So worth the up charge of $1.50. There are three options of Tomato Soup along with a Daily Soup to select from.\n\n Our orders arrived quickly even with the lunch crowd. The employees at the order counter are still in a learning curve but to be expected in first week. The Manager is engaged in all areas fine tuning this Cincinnati based franchise.

I was looking for a trash can when this young gentleman taking a break said, \"I'll take that for you.\" my daughter is crying for a new drink.  YATS employee who took my trash stops and says \" what was she drinking.\" We told him, and with a blink of the eye, the young man came out and gave her a free \"to go drink\".

In either case, the hummus was too pasty, the pita was cold, the chicken shawarma dry, the lamb overdone.   The highlight of the meal was the garlic paste, which makes everything better (except your breath).  Even that was too runny.  The kunafah was too formed, definitely not gooey enough.  The menu selection is quite limited. The place was pretty overpriced too for the quality.

Everything was on track to having an awesome meal.\nThere were five of us and a plethora of appetizers were ordered for the table. Calamari had a lite batter and came with lemon and cocktail sauce however was slightly overdone. Next the goat cheese torte wasn't overbearing and had a pretty good flavor. We also had grilled artichokes which were my favorite. It looked like they had a creamy balsamic sauce that worked well with the artichoke hearts. We also had bacon wrapped grilled shrimp which was overcooked. I decided to try the special of roast chicken lasagna. It was sheets of lasagna stuffed with cheese and chicken with a white sauce then topped with a basil sauce. Both texture and flavor were one note. It seemed like the sauce was nearly identified except basil and garlic were added.  It needed some grilled mushrooms or red peppers to give it intrigue.\nIt was an okay experience.","stars":3}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I really, really wanted to love this place, but you can't force love. I think I may have set my expectations too high after reading some of the other great reviews and the fact that their sister restaurant, Trattoria Marcella, has been a favorite of mine for many years. While Trattoria Marcella wins hands down in food and atmosphere, the service remains good and attentive at both locations.\n\nI chose Mia Sorella to celebrate my birthday with my parents. I was surprised they do not take dinner reservations, but the hostess told me over the phone we should be fine if we arrived at 6:00 or earlier. She was correct... our party of four was seated right away at 6:00. The decor of the space (or lack thereof) did nothing for me. The interior was very simple, dull, and bland. I noticed there was a large outdoor patio though, which might be nice in the warmer weather.\n\nThe food: Everything was decent, but nothing really \"wowed\" me. The white bread served with butter was good, but I prefer the ciabatta rolls with hummus served at their sister location. I ordered the filet topped with mozzarella and mushrooms, which came with sides of polenta and asparagus. Again, it was good, but nothing I would rush back for. The other members of my party ordered pizza, salmon, and a meatball sandwich. My parents really seemed to enjoy their selections, while my husband felt his meatball sandwich was just okay. He really enjoyed the parmesan fries that were served with his sandwich though. The one food item that did really impress me was the piece of complimentary tiramisu they gave me for my birthday. It was topped with chocolate custard, which I thought made it unique.\n\nSince the menu changes seasonally, I would be willing to give it one more try when it's warmer and I could enjoy the patio and something new off the menu. Until then...","stars":3}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Came here on a Saturday night for dinner.  I liked that they asked us if we'd prefer a booth or table, this makes a big difference to my wife. We started with a caesar salad and a romaine waldorf salad. For mains my wife had the 7oz filet and I had the sea bass. The filet was cooked perfectly and the sea bass was tasty.  We also shared a side of mashed potatoes that were delicious.  For dessert we had the vanilla cognac brownie prepared table side.\n\nThe service was adequate but could have been better. When our dinners were served I asked for another glass of wine and more bread, but I didn't receive them until we were done eating.  Our server also could have been more engaging with menu suggestions since we were first timers. He was going through the motions with the suggestive selling.\n\nWorth noting that we had our rehearsal dinner here 3 years ago and it was a fantastic experience.

When he brought the food home I was missing the rotel, the broccoli and cheddar, the chicken and dumplings, the chips for my kid and I got an unsweetened tea instead of a sweet one. I also had two chili's  The girl checked my food in front of him so the fact that the majority of my order was not it the bag after it being checked in front of him makes it more ridiculous. I called up there and described the situation with the kid on the phone who said he was the manager. I sent my fianc\u00e9 back up there to get the half of my food that was missing when he returned the bowl of chicken and dumplings had three dumplings and the rest was all chicken stock. I wasn't given napkins or silverware either. I worked at Mcalisters so I know how easy the job is. In the back you make the food according to ticket and place the order in the window, managers are usually supposed to check the tickets and bag the food accordingly. This is a simple job and a very easy job where it takes more work to mess it up than it does to do it properly. Being a manager you should have the skills to bag food right because if you can't manage to get all the orders together than how can you manage your staff or a business? The boy on the phone was polite and patient but it doesn't change the fact that I had to make two trips on an almost 40 dollar order. Pay attention to what you're doing. It's an easy job.","stars":2}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"If you're familiar with the Lafayette Square area, you know this place has been through seemingly uncountable incarnations. What has just opened as Apna Kitchen was formerly Spice Nation, before that Passage to India, and Udupi Cafe before that. I may be missing a few names in there, but what's held it together is that this space has always been home to one of the best Indian restaurants in the city, and Apna Kitchen seems poised to continue that tradition.\n\nThis four-star review is one I'm hoping I can raise to a five once Apna Kitchen finishes working out some of the initial kinks -- a few items on the menu weren't available yet, and service was a bit slow to start. But here's what you can already guarantee for yourself: 1) a delicious, freshly made meal; 2) huge portions that are very affordable, 3) a wide variety of food from many regions of India, and 4) a beautiful, comfortable, renovated space. \n\nThe meal starts off with complimentary papadums with a trio chutneys, all of which are delicious. That's good, because you can expect to wait a bit longer for a meal here than other Indian restaurants. And for good reason -- this goes far beyond the majority of Americanized Indian cuisine where you can expect a fashion show of meats and veggies in the same two or three curried sauces. \n\nThe menu is extensive, so plan to come with friends and share to try some different varieties. Here you'll find north Indian food, south Indian dosas and uthapams, biryanis, Indochinese, street food like chaat, and a few regional dishes from Sri Lanka, among other things. I'd recommend the gobi manchurian any time, and the onion kulcha was fantastic. While the biryani wasn't quite as good as you can get at Hyderabad House, it was still solid, and the Indochinese was some of the best I've had in the city. \n\nI've been looking forward to Apna Kitchen finally opening for a long time, and I can't wait to be back soon.","stars":4}

Now first let me say that I do not have the money to go eat up $9 slices of cake and pie ALL THE TIME. But when that splurge check hits my pockets-  \n\nlisten.  The Cake Bake Shop is where it's at. I won't try to name all the incredible cake and cookie and pie flavors they offer. I won't even try to describe how dainty and upper echelon the interior is. It's really frilly and flowery with a hint of a never ending spring. It's a great place for girlfriends to chow down on calories together.....the outdoor patio is all the rave. My sister, my niece and I all ate there for our Ladies Day Out after in the early morning. The crowd was low (get there early to avoid the wknd crowd) and the staff is bubbly and friendly. They offer more than cake, as someone recently told me. Tea, coffee, soups and maybe possibly I read that they serve salads? But that's not what I go there for. And never will. \n\nEvery single time I enter the threshold of the Cake Bake Shop, I will be there for dessert. The key lime pie is a mouth party. The key lime is perfectly sour-sweet and the homemade graham cracker crust that crumbles when your fork hits it is just the way any truthful person would want their graham cracker crust. I've also indulged in their Caramel Cake, which was like 50 layers. Ok, I'm over-exaggerating. It was six. Six or fifty - it was LAYERS and LAYERS of caramel cake with a buttery icing that fit perfectly between the layers. I've had their strawberry cake too, which is wonderful and full of that strawberry taste that would have made my old school Strawberry Shortcake doll very proud!!!!  I love this place. I love the atmosphere and the idea that there is a cute little house with an iron fence that serves cakes and pies. So why not Five stars??? \n\nYou know what....i don't have a reason.

To start, they label themselves as fast-casual, but the wait for my food was very long the day I went. This may have been due to higher than normal take-out volume, but it was still a bit frustrating. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and the fries. The sandwich was not quite spicy enough and the patty was  thick and juicy in some areas but then also a bit thin and underwhelming in other areas. The fries were over seasoned with what I'm guessing was some sort of meat seasoning, and I thought the fries tasted too savory and had too much pepper flavor.

Since I wouldn't be eating enough bread & cheese on the pizza, right? The mozz is FRESH. The tomatoes & olive oil flavoring really elevate the dish. Definitely recommend but be warned you will eat the entire plate. \n\nMy tried and true option that never fails me is the quattro fromaggio.

I usually just get to the point where I am about to hang up, call again and say \"NO! You cannot place me on hold again. Take my bloody order!\"\n\nThe staff can be friendly, usually. Many times they are aloof and much more interested in talking to each other than jumping to attention when I enter, saluting, and fawning over me until I leave with my pizza. I only do carry out, so, perhaps it is different with dine in. Very cozy place to dine in, I must say. Darker lighting, a few well placed TVs. Nice, higher-end pizza hole that one might find on a side street in New York.\n\nFive stars? Yes. This is the pizza that \"gets me.\" These elephant ear sized slices of pizza with flavorful grease dripping in copious amounts haunt my dreams. It is a Sirine's call of floppy, need-to-fold-to-eat perfection.\n\nThis is a place where less is more in the way of toppings. Just get the pepperoni. They are little ones that crisp up perfectly around the edges. Each bite (except for the massive end crust, I hate crusts anyway) is paradise. I think I will say it, here it comes......\n\nBest pizza, overall, I have ever eaten. Anywhere.\n\nYes there are pizza places more imaginative and cooler. This is traditional New York style, straight up in my mouth!\n\nOh, be sure to order their largest pizza to max out those slice sizes. And try their \"Gramma\" pizza. It is a deep dish with dollops of tangy marinara, better crust to pizza ratio and it is amazing. I often am torn between Gramma and their classic when I am on hold for that eternity I spoke of earlier, but I usually land back on the classic.","stars":5}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I took my car in on for a problem I was having with the stereo, while it was there I had them go ahead and fix a recall for the fuel delivery module on my 2013 Taurus.  This consisted of changing out the fuel pump and other components.  I came back a few days later to pick up my car.  I was told it was finished and checked out.  I then proceeded to go pump gas at a nearby gas station ..only to see that afterwards gas was free flowing from underneath my car.  I called the dealer and took it back.  They finally acknowledged and admitted to forgetting to put an O ring on.  From the gas station to Cerame was 3.5 miles in which case I lost a 1\/4 tank of gas. Spilling out all over the gas station...the way back to the shop and all over their parking lot. All I was told was...I'm sorry. I'M SORRY? Well I'm sorry as well. I'm sorry I brought my car there in the first place.  I never felt so disgusted with anyone in my life.  I mean I think of what could've happened. Thank God my kids weren't in the car with me at the time. One spark...anything...I was driving a rolling bomb. I had to spray body spray all over inside of the car after they finished putting the O ring back on because it reeked of gas so bad it was literally gagging me.  We have purchased over a dozen cars from Paul Cerame Ford since my husband transferred here from Detroit in 1982...working for Ford himself. But I will NEVER go back to this dealer for service, car purchases, anything. I'm sorry just doesn't cut it for me. You have lost us as customers for good.  Luckily there are plenty of other Ford dealerships in the area that will gladly accept our business.","stars":1}

They were good about texting us when our bay was ready. The issues i had were no one else was enforcing social distancing and everyone was very tight in the line, the other issues was only one person was opening the bays and one hour after opening the bays still weren't completely open which created a longer delay.

Both the rich vanilla (whoever says vanilla is blah has never tasted this stuff) and smooth chocolate are fabulous. We have driven by this place for years but never stopped by until this summer. \n\nAnd you know why we go now? We got a puppy! And we heard they give dogs a free Pup Cup. Our puppy gets car sick and the vet told us to take some fun car trips (not just to the vet). Nothing's more fun than frozen custard! So Puppy found us a new summer treat place. \n\nShe gets a pup sized dish of vanilla, which is actually pretty generous. We get to try the different toppings. Everything has been delicious, the staff is friendly, and there's plenty of seating if you want to sit in front. Oh, they have flavor of the day, too. All we care about is our happy puppy and our content bellies. \n\nUpdate: It's Memorial Day Weekend, and we splurged with some scrumptious frozen custard. I had a scoop of chocolate, just the right level of cocoa goodness. My two human companions had Flavor of the Day Samoa: toasted coconut, caramel, and hard shell chocolate mixed in with vanilla, concrete style. Both gave 5 stars on flavor, one gave 3 stars for meltiness as the concrete was maybe overmixed and started turning soupy too soon. Our dog gave 5 paws for her vanilla pup cup and begged for more. Whether you eat it at the tables, sit in your car, or get it to go, it's a great summer splurge.","stars":5}

I'm a ranch man and the have a uniquely tasty ranch. 2. Wings. Hermanki. Ask you'll get the story. 3. Tuesday steak special- bacon wrapped filet, baked potato, choice of soup or chili, and a salad for 12 dollars...I thought it was way to cheap to believe. However, it's true.

The issue I had was with how the theater was run. We were sitting near the back. The show started 10 - 15 minutes late, which wasn't a problem. The problem was that right on the ticket, it said that if you weren't in your seat, you would not be admitted for 20 minutes. There was a steady stream of people coming in through the first 10 minutes of the ballet. This was 20-25 minutes after the show was supposed to start.  We couldn't see anything during that time. If people can't get to their seats by the start of a program such as this, they should not be permitted to enter until intermission.

After finding some metered street parking near Union Station, I walked the block over to the trucks and decided to try out NY Slice (it is based out of the south side restaurant).  \n\nI saw there was an Italian Sausage Combo option available and went with that.  The menu states that the sausage comes topped with peppers and onions, as well as with a beverage, chips, and a cannoli (all for $11).\n\nSo I placed my order, paid, and waited a few minutes for them to call my name.  In fairness, it was after 1 pm when I placed my order, so it is possible that there had been a run on that choice.  But for whatever reason, instead of telling me they had run out of peppers and onions, someone in the truck decided to add the chili sauce instead.  I carried my meal when called back to my car and realized that I didn't get what I asked for.  I understand that if they run out, they can't go get more, but they should mention it to the customers.   Otherwise, you get bad reviews.  See how that works?\n\nThe sausage itself was fine.  Not very spicy.  Just enough to tell it wasn't a hot dog.  But without the blend of flavors that the peppers and onions would have provided, the sausage was disappointing.  The chili sauce was supposed to be spicy as well, but it wasn't.  And the flavor was not the great when paired with the Italian Sausage.  \n\nOverall, just a disappointing meal for the price.\n\nReview #2864","stars":2}

Within a year the arm rests started discoloring from \"wear\" even though we both work nights and the kids watch tv in the playroom so the couch is rarely used.  Then the edges of the cushions started cracking.  Even the seats have started to wear!  I couldn't believe it, leather in cars last for years and don't fade or crack even in direct sunlight all day.  Is it too much to ask for couches the same quality of car seats?  Even cheap leather coats don't fade and crack like this.  This wasn't some cheap on sale couch, we paid full price, thousands of dollars.  Now it looks like a 30 year old couch I bought from a garage sale.  I feel scammed.","stars":1}

The food was better.  So many restaurants talk a big game about seasonal produce but just because you have amazing fresh ingredients ... it doesn't mean you know how to use them.  They do. This is a kitchen with style, grace and soul.  The next day we had the leftovers as an Easter picnic and all was as good or better than the night before.  Fancy gimmick kitchen food would never hold up like that.  A couple days later I tried to recreate the salad course and got kudos from family for my rip off version ...  besides the wonderful family memory, they taught me to be a better cook.","stars":5}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Since we were halfway to our destination, we stopped and bought a $16 dollar oil plug hoping this would fix the issue, at least temporarily, but the oil pan simply would not hold the plug because it was stripped so bad. From this point, my car stopped holding any oil, it was just a constant leak.\n\nWe had to come home from our trip because it was unsafe to drive, and called the dealership first thing on Monday to tell them the issue, I spoke with Mark Phillips and had my inoperable vehicle towed in for them to look at. He stated I had a warranty through June 2017.\n\nI then received a call from Mark stating that we had damaged the oil pan when we put our oil plug in, and I was expected to pay $650 to replace the oil pan and plug. When I stated that I had a warranty and the it due to their negligence with telling me how they had rigged the plug to hold, he stated it was still our problem. I had my sister, whos a service manager at another dealership and speak with them, and Mark said, and I quote \"I can't prove or disapprove that we did it\". He also stated to me that placing a helical wire after an oil change in a Chevy Cruze is how they did their oil changes...Why was I not informed of this? THIS IS RIDICULOUS. \n\nYou would think something as simple as a windshield wiper replacement and oil change you wouldn't have any issues, but clearly they can't even do the most routine services correctly. Now, I have to take my vehicle elsewhere and hopefully not be charged $650 for a screw up they made. \n\nI used to love owning a Chevy, but after this customer service experience, I will never purchase another Chevy Vehicle again.","stars":1}

For starters, you'll find this small snow cone stand in the parking lot with a simple set up (really all the more you need for snow cones...). They offer three sizes of cones and an extensive lineup of flavor combinations with toppings available like coconut cream. I'm always a sucker for the pina colada combination with cream or ice cream added in. They don't offer ice cream but they do have coconut cream on the menu to take your cone to the next level. We also appreciated the vessels they serve the cones in (great for the mess that comes when it starts melting) and the spoons that changed colors when they're cold.\nThe young man working was friendly and efficient. I appreciate that he put on a new set of gloves for each order since he was working alone and also working the payment system. \n\nThe cherry on top for our experience was the pup cup which consisted of a snow cone with chicken broth and broken up dog bones.

It was still really good and I gobbled it down, even though I'm not exactly a fan of beets, but they're supposedly wicked healthy for you and eating them drenched in cheese, nuts and pesto is the best it's gonna get!\n\nI have not tried any of their \"famous\" desserts, so reserving the potential fifth star for them.\n\nBottom line: I work nearby so I'll come back for lunch, but I doubt I'd go too far out of my way to come here on a weekend.","stars":4}

I realized that the drink on the counter (iced latte) might be mine, so I mentioned to the barista that I hadn't gotten my drink yet. In a very short manner she told me that she was really busy and the only barista on staff, and that it would be out soon. I didn't have time to tell her I suspected there was a mixup, so I walked away and kept waiting. I finally found another employee to make the drink for me - the first person I talked to was SO rude.\n\nThe environment was fun - on Saturdays and Sundays there is live music, which made lesson planning a lot more bearable. I didn't find it hard to concentrate, even though there were plenty of people.\n\nThere are lots of windows, include a greenhouse-style one on the roof. It makes for some great natural light! We had to leave a little earlier than expected though because it became overly hot - I suspect this is largely because the outside temp was sweltering (95 degrees). \n\nOverall, a nice environment to get work done, though the employees aren't incredibly helpful.","stars":3}

So now, I decided to go to Traders Point Creamery - and I am so glad I did, and you will be glad you visited too!\n\nThe farm is on a gorgeous piece of land where a small herd of cows live a wonderful life. It's easy to understand why their milk tastes so buttery and delicious - they have a great diet and are cared for lovingly by the staff. The milking parlor is one of the cleanest you'll see, and ever cow is known individually by name and disposition, so the milking process (which you can observe daily at 7:30 pm) is gentle and easy on the girls.\n\nThe same loving attitude that the staff has in their care for the animals and plants on the grounds translates into their customer service. Every staff member I have had the pleasure of meeting - in the shop, the dairy bars, the restaurant, and on the farm, has gone above and beyond to make sure my experiences at the farm are exceptional. You really feel at home here.\n\nWhile other small farms have turned into varying degrees of Dairy Disney Land, replete with t-shirts to take home, Traders Point Creamery strikes a nice balance between creating a safe, clean environment for people of all ages to enjoy the experience of visiting of a working farm, without some of the excessive theme park-like frills of other establishments.\n\nEven though you can purchase some Traders Point Creamery merchandise and the restaurant is a significant part of the physical site and business, the farm stays fairly close to nature and can do so because it is such a small operation. Simply put: there's great quality control at every level.\n\nI hesitate a bit to get the word out about this place, because I like the quiet, peaceful atmosphere - but, it's too good not to share, and you should check it out!","stars":5}

The decor is clean and sleek, like a modern Asian hotel lounge.  Its a place that makes you feel comfortable, but with a side of hipness, as if you're in on a cool secret.\n\nThe real draw of any restaurant is the food, and Pad Thai has that covered.  Its easy to fall in to the trap of sticking with the tried and true (and the Pad Thai is fantastic), but don't do that to yourself here.   Try.  Everything.  You can adjust the spiciness of each dish, so even if you do always get the same thing (seriously, DONT!), you can change the taste each time.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Another nod for fresh PIZZA! \n\nFailoni's is a family owned restaurant\/bar that has been around for a very long time. It is best known as a blue collar lunch hangout, popular post game patio spot (w\/entertainment), and for their hopping Thursday night entertainment night, that fills up at happy hour and stays packed until closing. \n\nSome call Thursdays at Failoni's a \"cougar-fest.\" I disagree with that assessment because Thursday nights at Failoni's is clearly an all middle-age party night. So, if a young lad is there on the prowl... it's hardly a case of cougars out seeking cubs. \n\nFailoni's has always had a solid American\/Italian menu, but they recently added a full pizza kitchen and the pizza is good!!!!!   They serve St. Louis style (a little thicker). But, it is so much better than any St. Louis pizza that I have tasted. Most ingredients are standard Italian and fresh from the Hill. \n\nThey will put provel on your pizza unless you ask for mozzarella, but they offer both options. Good stuff!!","stars":5}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"My husband ordered dinner for our family on Friday (1\/8\/21) to pick up on his way home from work. I have an allergy, and after finding allergen information on the Sushi Boss website, ordered an OMG Roll without Boss Sauce. After my husband brought everything home, I happily opened my OMG Roll and began to eat it. Unfortunately, not being familiar with the appearance of the Boss Sauce, I didn't realize immediately that it was on the roll, despite clear instructions to omit it. After eating a few pieces and scanning everyone else's rolls, I realized that the sauce on top mine must be Boss Sauce. Thankfully, I don't have anaphylactic reactions to dairy, but I still do have very unpleasant side effects that I was trying to avoid. \n\nI called Sushi Boss and was told that they'd refund the roll and offered a free roll on my next visit. The man didn't take apologize or ask for any information other than my husband's name. Today (Tuesday), we didn't have a refund so I called the restaurant again, only to be told that the refund must come from Grub Hub, since that's how we placed the order (through Yelp). I'm not worried about the free roll since I won't be back, but I would like to be refunded for the dinner I couldn't eat and the physical distress I felt through the night as a result of the preparer's carelessness. I did call Grub Hub about the refund and got that going. \n\nTL;DR: If you have allergies, double-check your food before leaving with your take-out. Otherwise, you might very well be left sick and\/or without your meal. Everyone else enjoyed their meal, though, and the roll looked good.","stars":3}

The final cost was $1000 more than the quote.  \nI packed most of our stuff and asked them to pack the kitchen.  I gave them packing materials including dish boxes and towels and sheets to use.  They worked very slowly, and I caught them putting four unused dish boxes in a box, telling me they did not use them, I grabbed them back and said I would take them back to Lowe's for a refund.  They charged me for additional dish boxes and packed the towels and sheets in a box without using them as packing materials!  \nAs others have said, the delivery to Phoenix was late....14 business days does not include the weekends, yet they delivered on a Sunday.  Several items were poorly packed and damaged.  They left a damaged floor lamp outside, without bringing it in and we did not find it for two days!  \nGot the run around from customer service department (which is contracted out).  Direct quote when I called to check on my claim during business hours:   \"I'm not seeing it in the system and will have to check with the investigators and they have pretty much taken off for the day.\"  After many calls, I did get a Settlement Agreement, but never received the investigators report.  They offered me $40 (no I did not purchase extra insurance).  To get the $40, I had to fill out the form, have it notarized, and agree not to complain to the BBB or other agencies, or write negative reviews on sites such as YELP.

I had a Combo Fried Rice, which was good, but I was a little disappointed that my container was full of fried rice with a variety of meats (shrimp, BBQ pork, ham, etc.) across the top - as in the rice and meat didn't appear to be stir fried together.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I found this place earlier this year and thought this is my new auto repair shop. They had great reviews and I liked the experience there so I started bringing all 3 of my cars. But, everything changed on my last visit there! Dropped off my truck there for a battery positive line repair do to corrosion. Once they looked at it I was told need the entire line replaced $600 total. So I called dealer wanting to check if line would be covered under warranty and they say no because of the corrosion. Since I had them on the phone I asked them how much it would cost me they gave me a price $400. I was very disappointed to hear that because my local shop is quoting me $600 which is a lot more than the dealer and I thought dealers were always more expensive. I do under stand parts have to be marked some but $200 difference was definitely worth the call and take my truck to dealer. I called Christian Brother told them that, obviously they were not happy. I was charged $59 for half hour diagnostic which took probably 10min because I left a note stating what the issue is. They did not have to dig for the problem it's right there. I was very disappointed for being charged that much for 30minutes as being a customer there that brings 3 vehicles. I'm not asking for a free diagnostic but charging $59 for 10min of work is a rip off. They probably did that because I was taking my truck to ford now. But who wouldn't $200 cheaper at a dealer for the same job. I did mention this at the service desk and let them know I was not happy about it. They did not care! I got a very smart attitude back from the front desk employee. I'm sure a manager or owner will reply to this just so it looks good on yelp for their part of how sorry they are for the bad experience. Nobody cared when I was there.

I love the prices on their seasonal clearances items. Another benefit for me is they carry a wider variety of dairy products that I cannot get from Kroger or Marsh.

Usually I tell the chef to send out a few things of their choosing, but there are a few dishes I order every time I go. Always a fan of potatoes I love the Patatas dos Salsas. Fingerling potatoes that are crispy and covered in a spicy tomato sauce, I love these. If you eat lamb then you must get the Pinchos Morunos.

So when my car started overheating this past winter I took it in to them since my 'go-to' mechanic had a two week wait.\n\nIt was a huge mistake. 5 months later and over $2000 in repairs the car still isn't right. I finally got it in to my reliable mechanic (Wood Auto Repair in Whiteland) and it's going to cost me another $2000 to properly fix the car and undo the errors Edwards did (crossed wires, shorted out sensors, and things they simply missed that they shouldn't have). \n\nI've essentially replaced the entire cooling system on my car for no reason. Apparently Edwards didn't really know what the issue with my car was so they guessed. Over and over again, hoping that 'this time' they got it right apparently. I had it in half a dozen times in just a couple of months and every time they assured me it was fixed and I would drive it a day and it would break down again. Once it left me stranded on the side of the interstate with my daughter in the back seat, while smoke billowed out from under the hood. \n\nWhen it started giving me issues the last time I called the Greenwood location and was apparently directed to a central number. (The woman answered the phone with a rather rude \"Hello?\", not identifying it as Edwards, which was a bit off-putting.) I was told the Greenwood location was undergoing reorganization, whatever that means, and I needed to take it to the Southport location. I did so and discovered they have no waiting area and I would have to drop my car off and leave it just to find out what the problem was. I'd used up most of my vacation and sick time from work already dealing with these people so that was the last straw for me. \n\nI'll never use them again and I'll make sure none of my friends or family do either. If they couldn't figure out the problem they should have said so, and should have refunded all the labor costs I had to pay. They are crooks. I wish I could give them negative stars.","stars":1}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"We moved to the area in June 2015 and set up the orthodontist consultation on July 1 2015.  Dr. Bankhead recommend both of my kids 13 yrs old son and 10 yrs old daughter for the treatment.  We immediately made the decision to have the treatment start with suresmile techology, paid in full the same day,  they were able to immediately accomdate the schedule to have the braces on the same day.  It seems great.   However,  I did not realize the initial discussion for the treatment plan with dr. Bankhead would be different drs seeing my kids for after first visits,  most of time with dr. Alex.  I don't really have much problems with it but would hope this would have explain upfront.  \n\nOn Feb 2016,  we learned that we have to move back to east coast.  With the discussion with drs,  they said my kids reposnse to the treatment very well,  It is possible to get them done before we move at the end of july 2016.  \n\nAt the end of June, they have been attempted to remove the braces from my kids while I have to point out all these significant problems with my kids teeth adjustments (very obvious problems).   I am just a regular mom, not orthdonist.  I had to point out all the issues to Dr. Alex,  he would say \"yes,  these all need to be adjusted to close the gaps, to get teeth overlap suppose to be\".   I told drs, 4 month ago, my expectation is to finish the treatment here if possible, however,  I don't want to be rushed to just take the braces off for the sake to be done with it.  They all understand it... Finally,  a few appointments to make all the adjustments. Dr. Alex cheked the teeth and told me they all looks very good, they are taking them off today (July 22) which they did.  Thet suppose to do a scan for my kids teeth but the scanner have been broken. I can not really have a view.   After they took off the braces,  I notice significant noticeable problems with my daughter's teeth.  Left and right side looks not the same,  after came home,  my husband said my daughter front teeth got push to a little buck teeth, which can view clearly from side view.  I am not sure why we can see the problems while the orthdonist can not see... I understand that they just want to get it done with.  I will need soultion for this as I already paid in full on the first day.\n\nThe other disappointment from this office was for the whole year orthdonist appointments for my two kids,  I was only late 2 times,  1st late was 10min becasue I missed a turn and had to circle around which did not experienced much issue with the office.\n2nd time was July 22 appointment, I was late 20min (my kids had 1.5hours time slot appointment). As a working mother, I had to take off from my meeting in middle of day  and got my kids from the summer camp drive as fast as I could to get there.  I understood it was my fault for being late 20min.  However, one of assistants was rude to cut off my converstaion with dr. Alex about my kids teeth because she said the schedule was behind.  Again,  I understood my 20min late so I apologize for that.  However,  1.5hour appointment,  they let us wait for 3 hours intentionally.  I have been very patiently stand there and my kids sat in the chair without any complain until 3 hours later,  This was really unaccpetable as my son would miss his final basketball tournment if I continue to wait.  After I said to this assist and dr. Alex,  then he came to finish the 3min job that he suppose to do that we wait for hours.  \n\nThis is just very disappointed for the final experience that we had with the office.  \n\nEmmy","stars":2}

A sense of culture and elegantly decorated, but still comfortable and a great gathering spot to spend time with friends and family. \n To start the evening the had a few different wine \"flights\" to sample 4 wines, sparkling, reds, lux , and create your own. Or craft cocktail beverages, I got an amazingly prepared Mai Tai garnished with several fresh fruits. \n  We all enjoyed different appetizers as well, cheese tray sampler which included fresh honeycomb and figs, calamari glazed in a delicious Asian zing sauce. We also got the tostadas and ahi tuna tacos. All adequately portioned and of great fresh quality. \n  Then time for our main courses. So many to choose from seafood and surf & turf to vegetarian options and pastas. I got the crispy fish sandwich on a brioche bun with crunchy Asian slaw and zesty sauce. It also came with some great tasting seasoned fries. My friends got a lot of different options, pork, braised beef risotto, Mediterranean shrimp salad, filet mignon and pistachio crusted grouper and a cilantro cream chicken sandwich.  All came out looking amazing and everyone loved them. \n  We all were stuffed but the tastes were simply out of this world. True thought and chef skills went into each dish and it showed. \n\n  The service was ok, nothing over the top and he seems a bit unsure at times with some of our questions.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"One thing I want to address in this review has to do not with the restaurant, but with you, my humble reader and\/or dinner date. Over the years, the one thing I have found most boring, if not pestiferous about the whole cooking, eating experience, is the insistence on 'authenticity.' I live in the Midwest. While many restaurants and chefs make sincere attempts to replicate the actual cuisines of distant locales, it doesn't always work. They do the best they can, and what they create is often delicious. Is it authentic? Who gives a rat's a**? When I am enjoying a slice of pizza, it only detracts from my enjoyment to have you tell me how it can't compare to Chicago deep-dish pizza; and when I am having my morning bagel, I don't want to hear about New York bagels. I want you to shut up, Ms. or Mr. Know-it-all, and let me enjoy my meal. \nBoogaloo advertises itself as a Cubano\/Caribbean\/Creole eatery. That's a hard trifecta to pull off, as each cuisine is related but not the same. My date when I visited had spent many years in Miami and eaten a lot of Cuban food close to its source. Boogaloo lists as a special its Cubano sandwich. I wanted to try it, but my date let me know in no uncertain terms that they could get most of the ingredients right, but without the real Cuban bread, it would never work. So I just let it go. Did that add to my dining experience? Of course not.\nI ordered a bowl of black bean soup and Caribbean tacos--the flank steak filling. The black bean soup was tasty, though mostly a puree, and I prefer a hardier bean soup. The tacos were very good, lots of filling, interesting toppings, and a sweet and sour sort of sauce on the side. \nMy date had a pulled pork sandwich, which I tasted, and it brought back to me the small smokehouses my grandfather used to take me to in rural Tennessee. Wish I had ordered that. I definitely will next time, and I do intend to come back, even though SOMEBODY has ruined the Cubano sandwich for me.","stars":4}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I have heard great things about Peacemaker through reviews and word of mouth. While I have not been, I did get a chance to sample their food at the 4-Hands Brewery. I went up there with a group of friends Wednesday night after work. It wasn't overly busy for a Wednesday night, but I think the problem started when there was only one person manning the food window. The poor guy got overwhelmed at times and just could not handle the stress. That being said, that's one knock against them, the other knocks come from what I ordered and my friends sampled. I was in the mood for some mussels and when I saw that they had some, I couldn't help but order. \n\nThe mussels were overcooked, they were dry, there was absolutely no natural juices and the shellfish themselves had a fishy odor which was off-putting.  I did like that you get a good amount in the bucket that you are served in, the toast is perfectly crispy and perfect for sopping up the broth in the bottom I just wish there was more of that as well. \n\nI got an order of the blue crab dip to share with the people at my table, with a companion pretzel although I wasn't sure what that was. It's kind of like a pretzel log but not that hard type, the more along the lines of the pretzel roll, and there's only one not much for sharing and neither is the size. It is most definitely not worth the money charged. There was no crab in there that I could tell, and there was a sweetness to it that was not what I was hoping for. Now maybe I got spoiled when I lived on the coast and got good seafood all the time. \n\nTheir saving grace I believe would be the brisket nachos, the brisket is delicious on those. They're served on thick cut potato chips which were very nice and handled the toppings very well. First impressions are everything and Peacemaker did not make a good first impression.","stars":2}

I reach out again on July 15th, and get no response.  Today is August 13th, and I have not heard from Don.

I had researched them and they seemed good but I didn't know how much they charged or if their oil change service included changing the oil filter.  I called them and they told me it did include the oil filter, so I went.\n\nWhen I got there, there was 1 car in front of me, then it was my turn.  I pulled up and opened the window.  I talked to the guy there, telling him what I wanted and he got my information.  By the time I'd answered all his questions, they were done.  I thought they were very fast.\n\nSince it's hard to find, I'll post the prices here.  I got the full synthetic oil change and that was $90 (oil filter change included).  You can get a regular oil change for about $52.  There was a synthetic blend that was somewhere in between.  I found a price list online that had the full synthetic for $80, and I asked about it but they didn't know anything about it.  He asked me what brand it was because that could make a difference.  It's whatever kind of oil Valvoline uses.  I don't think they keep multiple brands and types in stock.  So it seemed a bit pricey to me.  But I don't have what I need to change it myself and my usual place takes too long, so this worked out ok.  I might go here again, or maybe not.  I really was impressed with how fast they were, but like I said, I found them a bit pricey.","stars":4}

A man emerged from the back of the restaurant and just sort of stared at me and my partner.  We asked if he was open.  He replied yes.  He then shuffled slowly towards us to seat us.\n\nHe dropped menus on the table.  Then he came back and dropped silverware and water glasses on the table.  Then he came back and sort of grunted at us, asking if we were ready to order.  \n\nWe ordered two apps and two mains.  Lotus root salad and ground chicken salad.  I don't recall the mains, but I asked for mine extra spicy.  The food was DELICIOUS.  Truly amazing.  And very good value.\n\nThe service (the grunting man) left a lot to be desired.  That may be why we were the only diners the whole time we were there, yet the other Asian restaurant around the corner was packed?\n\nIf you can look past a surly server, this place definitely has excellent food!

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Great chicken wings but truly awful pizza.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by the really good pizza I've been eating in Chicago.  Their wings give them 5 stars, but their pizza takes two away.  The service was indifferent at best, but we did get our food in a timely manner. Hubby said his pizza was \"ok\" but also said he wouldn't go out of his way to come back.  Soggy crust, dry sauce, minimal cheese and niggardly amounts of toppings (particularly on a pretty expensive pie) do not a memorable pizza make.  The wings were ordered with medium sauce that had zero flavor or heat--tasted like they'd been dipped in margarine.  However, they were big, and cooked crispy, which makes me happy enough to eat them and give them 3 stars.  I can't speak for their Italian dishes, but the pizza was astonishingly mediocre.","stars":3}

It has a latin theme in a really welcoming two story brick building. It's not a huge restaurant, but there's definitely plenty of space for all of the hustle and bustle that's going on. My only complaint is the parking, but it's the city, so there's plenty of paid parking in the area and Livery has valet as well. I love the open air feel inside the restaurant. I'd say my favorite spot is probably a seat at the bar upstairs. \nLivery has a great selection of shareables and sizeable entrees. Because they are latin themed, most of the shareables are tapas size or latin options. Some of my favorites are the empanadas, the fish and the steak. But my absolute favorite surprisingly is the cauliflower off of the appetizer menu. I don't know what they do to it, all I know is that I'm addicted to it. Every time I go back I say I'm going to get something different, but I still end up getting the cauliflower. My favorite trio is the carriage house margarita, the cauliflower and end with the steak! Pure Perfection! \nI've always had great service as well! Since I'm dining alone, I typically sit at the bar and their bartenders are always top notch!\nThere are so many restaurants in the area and I plan to go somewhere different every month that I'm in town for work, but I always end up back at Livery!","stars":5}

In fact, everyone there was nice enough, period.  The service was very friendly, in other words. We had beer cheese pretzels and pickle fries, which were in fact fried pickles, but done in an attempt to make them appear as much as a French fry as they could. Appearance wise, it wasn't quite perfect, but yep, we ate them all. \n\nAlso had the beer cheese burger, which was good, too, but the highlight was the fries, which came with a great dipping aoli. There was a few tricky herbs on the fries, and they were delicious!  The rest of my table all had chicken sandwiches and pulled pork, and I was kind of bummed that nobody had the grilled cheese because I wanted to at least see it, if not steal a bite.\n\nFor beer, I'm a bit different, so I tried and enjoyed the 'Apple Pie' which does have a lot of apple extract in it. It was like a very dark spiced cider. Not exactly thirst quenching it you're hot, but nice for the fall. Others in my party dug the blueberry brew.\n\nGo. Enjoy. And as always, GO CUBS!!","stars":4}

We end up getting take out from here frequently, because we have a small child and can't stand around for a table anymore.\nWe have our favorites here and usually like to try one new thing each time but honestly we usually end up going to back to our classics.\n\nThe lamb skewers taste just like the ones we've had on the streets in China, but it's only available at night--worth going here just for these!\n\nThe sizzling eggplant is amazing but not so good for take out. It's nice that they give you the sauce separately so it doesn't get soggy but the eggplant is fried so either way it gets soggy by the time we get home and add the sauce.\n\nBoiling fish-- giant chunks of the softest fish and bean sprouts floating in oil with sichuan peppers. Avoid the peppers and snatch up the fish over some rice. I don't eat spicy but I love this one. We also always take home the leftovers and add the oil to noodles and various things for the rest of the week.\n\nThe beef noodle soup really hits the spot in winter, but my favorite is their wonton soup. It tastes truly authentic like they just folded them, and the touch with the pickled\/sour veggies in the broth is a great touch. When I'm sick, this is the soup I want, all day, err day.\n\nChengdu chicken - way too spicy for me but my Chengdu-born hubby loves it so we always get it.\n\nTwice Cooked Pork - another favorite of our, the vegetables in this are so tasty they're tastier than the pork, in my opinion (don't tell my husband I wrote that). It's spicy and flavorful.\n\nWe weren't a fan of the sweet and sour pork, and also not that fancy candy floss potato thing. It looks cool but is so frustrating to eat! \nAlso, don't get the bun skewers! There's no filling at all, it's literally just buns... on a skewer... I realize we sound like we got what we ordered but it's totally not worth the price and doesn't add much to the palate unless you just wanted some super basic buns with your food.\n\nOverall, I love this place and I'm glad they're getting business but I really wish they could handle the crowds better, they need a bigger space! I would love to have all of this food fresh and sitting down instead of having to take it home, (but I'll do it)!","stars":5}

This week, as I came into town for the Thirty Seconds to Mars concert at The Pageant (see my review!), I came in ready to pay the Hard Rock Cafe of St. Louis another visit. \nWe walked in around 1:00 or 1:30 on a Wednesday, so we basically had the place to ourselves. The hostess seated us immediately, letting us even choose what booth we wanted. Our waiter came by a minute later and took our drink orders while we looked over our menus. \nI opted for a small lunch, going with a side of garlic smashed potatoes and a side salad. The potatoes were piping hot and were seasoned with real garlic instead of just garlic powder which is cheating in my book. The only thing they needed was a little bit of butter, otherwise, I loved them. My salad was loaded for what I was expecting to get - cheese, bacon, croutons, tomatoes and dried cranberries (totally unexpected but yum!).

In fact, it was so good that I went back for an early dinner. \nI order a cup of broccoli cheese soup, a large vegitarian sandwhich and a small cup of coffee.  What I got was great soup, a carnivore lovers meat sandwhich and no coffee.  When I went to inquire about my coffee, the young lady who took my order said, \"no you didn't\".  I think she only heard what she wanted to hear about my order, because the only thing she got right was my soup.  I was not up to arguing my order, so I removed all the meat from my sandwhich and made it the best I could then left. I will be back in St Louis again, but might try some place else. It's too bad because the place has potential.","stars":3}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"My experience here was that of a typical, decent Brazilian steakhouse.  The atmosphere was nice, neither cheap nor ostentatious.  The waiter and other staff were all very polite and seemed to be trying to project an air of refinement.  And they pretty much succeeded.  While some other reviewers actually seemed to find fault in this, as if it was trying to project an atmosphere above that of the food, I found it refreshing.  As is normal, there was a food bar to peruse before the meats came.  While I knew not to load up on it, the waiter was thoughtful enough to warn us to just take a couple of light items so that we saved room for the meats.  Caramelized bananas were served as part of the various courses that came out before the meats.  1 - I didn't really care for how we had to work through rice balls (although these were pretty good), bananas, and Brazilian mashed potatoes before the meats came around.  2 - I like the bananas to come out as part of the choices with the meats; that way it serves as a lightener and cleanser between meats.  As for the meats themselves, I had no complaints.  All I tried were typical good fare.  The servers came around frequently, and most meats were rare to medium.  So three stars is about right to me.  It was good.  It wasn't an extra special Brazilian steakhouse, but I left satisfied.","stars":3}

I had the stuffed grape leaves (dolma) which were super flavorful with the perfect amount of seasoning. For my main I had chicken adana, it was kind of a chicken sausage cooked on a skewer. Very juicy and flavorful. The sides left something to be desired (veggies, salad and rice). My friend had a dish that was similar to gyro meat and it was phenomenal. Turkish coffee is great too!

A-OK means I will go back--especially if I want a good burger.\n\nIt's really nothing to look at, but you can go somewhere else if you want to look. It has the appearance of not being fully decorated or thought out yet. But it was clean and the dining room was nice in that they had linens on the table, covered by white paper, on which you could draw. I like something under my plate--it feels cleaner that way. I did appreciate those touches.\n\nOn a Thursday night at dinner time, my husband I were the only ones in the dining room. The bar was full of people eating and drinking. We each had burgers-\"Just a Burger\" it's called. We had a long wait; our waiter was the bartender, and he explained that everyone came in at once and ordered food. He gave us a free beer to make up for the wait. That, coupled with a coupon in advertising, gave us a very low bill. Always a pleasure. I think a dinner at Hardee's would have cost about the same!\n\nThe burgers were good, but my fries were limp and greasy--like they had sat around a bit. I really can't say I like them, all limp like that. I don't think that was the intention. My husband got the onion rings as a side, and they were really big and obviously hand dipped. The batter was thick and maybe a little odd--was there corn meal in it? I thought the batter was a little too thick, as you could hardly taste the onion inside. \n\nTHe peach cobbler sounded really good, but we were quite full from our large burgers, which I couldn't finish actually. I felt kind of sick later in the evening, and I attributed that to the greasy fries. If I get them like that again, I will definitely send them back. \n\nI hope this doesn't sound too negative, especially with my last comment. I will go back.","stars":3}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Please Look at similar reviews - Tokio Marine HCC is the Worst Health Insurance Ever. I just finished filing my complaint with the BBB.  I've used this Tokio Marine HCC Life insurance during my long-distance move to a new state in the middle of the year (past Obamacare Open enrollment).  My husband's new job does not cover insurance for me and our 3 children.  I was told by an insurance broker that this could be my temporary health insurance and we've (tried to) use HCC Tokio Marine for our health insurance for the past 4 months.  I will also NOT use this health broker again!  The HCC insurance only lasts 6 months and then you are required to get a more permanent insurance.  This Tokio Marine insurance does their best to NOT cover anything at all.  You go through a very difficult process to file any type claim (and I am good on computers!), but claims provide no discount as your deductible is $7,500. Their website is also very user unfriendly and doesn't guide you.  It tries to block you.  You always have to call and have someone walk you through the steps on their website, which is very time consuming.  Let me repeat: when your deductible is $7,500 until the insurance covers anything at all, you basically do NOT have health insurance. Nobody reaches $7,500 a year unless you are hospitalized. Prescriptions meds are also NOT covered even 1% with HCC.  You also can't have had ANY previous medical needs because existing conditions are NOT covered AT ALL.  So if you fill out the form saying the condition started 6 months ago, and you've only had the insurance for 4 months, it will not be applied towards your very large deductible.  Also, there is no copay or insurance discount, like there is with other insurances that provide discounts.  You get to pay the FULL amount on your bill from doctor's offices.  Nobody recognizes this insurance.   You cannot get prescriptions refilled with any sort of a discount.  Tokio Marine HCC says you get one at CVS, Walgreens, Rite-Aid, and a few other pharmacies, but when you go there and actually try it, there is no prescription discount.  It is better to use MediCAL or visit the County hospital and pay Cash, than have this (Fake) insurance.  Trust me, you will pay hundreds of dollars each month and only get a headache and more bills in return!  This insurance is only supposed to cover a MAJOR ACCIDENT and due to the difficulty to even file a very small claim with them just once a month, I doubt that an accident would even be covered at all.  They are swindlers and get you into a bind where you pay $$$ and get NOTHING in return.  I would rather have NO insurance than this one.  I am paying $500 a month and getting absolutely NOTHING back, except doctors' offices telling me that nothing is being covered by HCC, AND constant letters from HCC telling me to log on and keep giving additional info over and over again about the condition or why I visited the doctor's office.  As if the doctor's word wasn't enough.  Can I give them a zero stars rating?  DO NOT BUY THIS INSURANCE!  You will get NOTHING but a headache and robbery from your bank account.","stars":1}

As a result of management's lack of listening or helping I explored other options and joined the YMCA.

I like the Monon facility and love the Tuesday Thursday aqua classes at the Monon bc of the instructor Joy, but limiting the class size to only 12, that's TWELVE, people is so ridiculous we have to set a 5 am alarm to sign in, but today it was nearly full with 10\/12 signed up by 5:01. The Monon is not willing to open up another lane for a 50 minute class to expand the class size to accept more participants yet there are empty lap lanes every time to make space but management refuses to make allowances and doesn't care. We're tired of being ignored. Classes were not only reduced in sizes, the number was also cut in offerings. There used to be 2 classes at least 3 times a week before Covid, now just one class 4 days a week plus one addition one day.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I had an appointment for an oil change at Lou Fusz Toyota on Manchester in Kirkwood. I had purchased a package when I bought my Toyota that provided a number of \"free\" oil changes (actually paid in advance, but why bitch now). I arrived 15 minutes early, gave them my info and went into the \"customer lounge\" to wait. \nPrevious oil changes have taken maybe 30 minutes max at oil change stations.  \nThe \"customer lounge\" has  2 expensive vending machines if you want something other than a complimentary paper cup of stale coffee or a cookie. No magazines other than Golf magazines!  3 tv's each tuned to a different channel and with no sound. We could watch the Insurance girl try to drum up business though through the windows in her office though.\nAfter waiting an hour, I went to see why my car wasn't done. Even though I had an appointment, they were JUST starting! Finally, after another hour (2 hours total!) later, and after I complained numerous times, my car was done. When I asked why it took so long, even though I had an appointment, I was told it was because \"they wash the car\" before returning it to the customer!!! Fortunately, I did find out that I can get my \"free oi changes\" at another Fusz dealership.  At all costs AVOID LOU FUSZ TOYOTA for service, unless you have nothing else to do that day! They really are not customer friendly. Obvious from the look of the \"lounge\" to the stale coffee to the rediculous time it took to change the oil!\nIf you do go there, don't say you wern't warned!!!","stars":1}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"It was so hard to determine where to rank the experience of going to this place for dessert.  Consequently +\/- follow:\n\n+ pretty good mint chip ice cream\n+ neighborhood place instead of a commercial setting \n+ plenty of outdoor seating\n+ great vibe\n\n- hellacious wait (about an hour for us and the line kept growing) \n- safety concerns (employees handling liquid nitrogen and a propane torch with zero PPE) scare me\n- small space means you can find yourself standing in line out in the heat for quite a while\n\nIf this place is on your list you should probably get there sooner rather than later as they may not have staying power. Considering what I can see of the business model and cycle time\/throughput issues, I cannot imagine they are experiencing sufficient positive cash flow to sustain operations for the long term.  That said, I'm glad for the experience but won't be rushing out again soon to stand in line for basically average ice cream with a slightly premium price.\n\nGoing somewhere with Yelp friends always makes it a better experience. Five stars for the company and the unique experience but not a place I will frequent.","stars":2}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I had heard a lot about Milque Toast Bar and love trying out new breakfast spots so I finally got around to trying it this week. It's a little out of the way but easy to find parking. I was apprehensive about finding space to sit inside based on previous reviews and pictures but we easily found seating outside on the side \"patio\". \n\nThis is a very down to earth, kitschy, DIY space that I can appreciate. But there is VERY limited seating inside, one long table and maybe something else I didn't notice? Who knows? Very cramped inside. Not the friendliest service but that is always just the - (minus) on an already iffy experience.\n\nIt was nearly impossible to read the menu chalk board as most of the writing is now very faint or all but gone. That was the first issue. \nThere were no paper menus in sight so we just kinda stood there struggling to decipher the very vague descriptions and almost nonexistent writing. \n\nWe ended up trying the crudo toast with tomato and basil and the fruit and cream toast. We both very much enjoyed our toasts even though we weren't sure what to expect with a lack of description. The brioche was an unexpected surprise, making the strawberries and cream cheese toast taste like a french toast entree. BIG +. Not a fan of the reconstituted raisins for the simple reason that they tasted only of thyme, but I appreciated the side of fruit. \n\nNever received any utensils or napkins with the meal which made it really messy to eat. We also got the \"Fizz\" sodas. One of them a \"nutty\" herb and the other rose, green and pink respectively. I wish they hadn't dyed the soda, which I assume they did, it made me feel iffy about drinking though. The rose one tasted overwhelmingly like flowers. If that is your thing, great, but I felt like I was drinking floral soap. The nutty one tasted like a dessert. \n\nThe price is the best part of the meal, as is the portion size. It's a great value. I also really dug the bread they used. Not ideal for sitting and relaxing but the patio space was nice and it looked like they had a backyard stage which would be fun for late night concerts. Probably will not be back but I'm glad we tried.","stars":3}

What a choice of venue made, pat on my own back!\n\nI started off with the Passport drink due to multiple readers recommending it. It's vodka drink flavored with basil. While I could taste the basil they didn't put the leaves in the drink. I think I'd have liked to see that. I also thought the drink should have been stronger. \n\nNote that you need to ask for their bread as it says in the menu. My server was courteous enough to notice that I was waiting for my boss and asked me if I would like so bread. Good job! \n\nAfter my boss arrived we were given a tour of the menu and brief talk about how the ingredients are carefully sourced. We tried the fried green tomato flatbread which was awesome. \n\nFor my meal I tried the rabbit biscuits and gravy which tasted awesome! Biscuits and gravy is not an easy thing to innovate upon, and the restaurant has done it quite well. There are various hidden flavors, likely rosemary and others; the gravy was excellent not thick, just moist enough. The rabbit meat was a little hard to find though :). \n\nWe finished the meal with the yelper recommended sticky toffee pudding. The server was smart enough to advise us to share it. It's huge but it's insanely delicious. How I wished there was one more scoop of ice cream on the top. \n\nAbout the ambience, The music in a classy place like this should be discreet and soft. That was not the case. Also the patio looked amazing but only if I had spotted it earlier. \n\nOverall a great experience:\nService: 5\nFood: 4 ( off for the liquor and scarce amount of rabbit meat)\nAmbience: 4","stars":4}

They stacked heavy boxes on top of fragile items, damaged many of our Items and multiple pieces of furniture, gouged baseball sized chunkS of drywall out of our walls; scratched our hardwood floors in both houses, bent our copper plumbing main water line by ramming something into it, played around and wasted time throughout, asked inappropriate questions, left a huge mess everywhere they went, were rude, and inflated material costs by charging me for almost full rolls of shrink wrap they used once then left around the house. Not a single redeeming quality about this moving experience with Here to There movers beyond the fact that some of our items survived unbroken. I've called their customer service twice within 24 hours of our move and left a voicemail with no reply about 12 hours ago. I've yet to hear back from them.

It's FREE and you only pay for parking, unless you want to park a little farther away and walk down Grant's Trail. Or you can ride your bike if you live close (like me). There are coupons out there for parking, so we got it for $7 (usually $12). \n\nThe tram ride is so fun and informative. You always see different things when you go, from wild mustang to buffalo, cattle, sheep, and even ostrich! The deer park is awesome. They tell you enough facts about the grounds and animals to be interesting but not overwhelming. The farm part is not large so it's easy to do it in a short period of time. You can extend your visit by planning to see the elephant show and\/or animal encounter show. We saw the elephant one and it was great! Crowd got involved, was informative and fun. You can also feed parakeets or goats, ride a camel or pony, and get free beer. It's got something for everyone!

You can do margarita flights and the beers on tap feature local breweries (Bier, Sun King) as well as some from Ohio (Rhinegiest!).  I love the open garage doors, the decor (waaaaaay different yet totally Condado-ish from the Ohio location), and the friendly staff. \n\nToday was the first day of the Brunch menu - and OMG.

I also opted for my go-to Sweet Lucy base with the Thai Chili Tofu.  Add the Jicama slaw and other amazing toppings of your choice for slightly sweet and crunchy goodness. \n\nCourtney B was UH-MAZING and helped us navigate the new brunch menu.

The only complaint that I will say is I wish they wrapped in a little better so I didn't have to do it myself, and that the pita was perhaps a little too soft. It almost got a little mushy and I wish I had a different texture to compliment the awesome meat and veggies. \n\nBaklava was also super good!

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"There aren't enough curse words and too many stars to describe our non-experience at Asaka last night. We walked in at 7:15 on a Saturday. The place was packed. Not surprising. What was surprising was the complete lack of service or direction on behalf of the staff. As this is a family website, I will be editing my language accordingly.\n\nThree servers - heretofore known as Minnie Mouse, Amy Winehouse, and Mom - ran around like the Keystone Cops, congregating at the POS computer to place orders, then scattering to... I'm not sure. It sure as sheep dip wasn't to clean empty tables or greet potential customers. These fuzzy coots purposely kept their eyes down every time they'd approach the lobby, where we, along with four other groups of two, were waiting for further instruction. One optimistic woman asked Winehouse, on one of her trips to the cash register, how long she expected the wait to be. Winehouse mumbled \"15 minutes\" and then hauled asphalt out of the line of fire. The only other exchange we had with her (or any other employee in this God-forsaken place) was when she came through carrying a tray of salads and said, \"Excuse me, I'm trying to serve this food!\" Oh, really? Because we're all trying to sit down and order it, sugar. \n\n Inexplicably, there was an already-seated customer of Japanese descent who got up from his table to stand by the door and hold several menus. He looked for all the world like a host, but seemed genuinely offended that so many people were asking him to put their name on the waiting list. Then don't stand at the entrance holding mickey-fickey menus, you jackwagon!\n\nOther attempts, albeit futile, were made to establish some sort of contact with the employees of Asaka. One guy got right in Mom's personal space at the POS station... he seriously stood five inches behind her, breathing over her shoulder, and she totally ignored his presence. I should also mention that aside from the dirty tables, which no one was bothering to clear off, not one party had received their food.\n\nWe put up with this fox-plucking bullpucky for about 12 to 15 minutes, at which point we decided to say \"Flick it\" and leave. It was sort of like admitting defeat, because I know that's exactly what these bozos wanted us to do, but it was 7:30 PM, I hadn't eaten since 9:30 that morning, and even if we'd been seated at that moment, I wouldn't have tipped any of them one dime.\n\nIn all seriousness, this was the absolute worst display of customer service - or the lack thereof - I have seen in my entire life. I really couldn't give a flying squirrel if the specials are written in Japanese (how adorably exclusive) or if it's the cheapest place to get sushi within a hundred miles. If you can't handle something as simple as crowd control on a busy Saturday and you choose to just ignore those who are patient enough to wait... that's flat-out unacceptable. One server acting that way - annoying and unprofessional, but you can work around it. But all three of them seemed to have banded together to run off every single person that walked through the door. I guess their plan worked, because I will never, ever return to Asaka.\n\n Duck this fudging place.","stars":1}

Refusing to make coffee on our living room floor, from one of the few remaining working outlets, my roommate and I did the only sensible thing: we breakfasted at BitterSweet Bakery. \n\nWe've decided that perhaps losing power now and then wouldn't be so bad, since breakfast at BitterSweet totally makes up for having to pee, or put your mascara on, in the dark. \n\nI'm not sure what Kelly B is talking about, because at 7:30 a.m., we were greeted by the most delightfully charming patisserista* I have met in a long time. While she couldn't produce the promised Sweet Brie and Pear savory pastry, she made up for it with her charm and care. And, the bacon and gruyere cheese was not a shabby second place prize.

That's fine, as a former server for years, I get that it's a little nervewracking the first few times you have your own section. It was kinda cute, and his earnestness made me smile. But, when he left our table, he'd disappear. Like, for a long time. \n\nThe second time I headed to Sage, I could tell we had a seasoned server. She was actually pretty good, except she was absolutely slammed. The restaurant wasn't slammed, but I think she was the only server on the main floor. I felt kinda sorry for her, because she was doing the best she could, but I also felt sorry for our table, which sat for over ten minutes before we were greeted\/brought drink menus\/etc. \n\nDinner, meh. Better the first time, OK the second. Had an off-menu special of a Greek seafood salad that was pretty darn good. Spinach salad with Bacon dressing wasn't too shabby, big portion. \n\nSecond visit, less impressed. Smoked trout salad was over-dressed and a bit one-note.

The market offers a great variety of Indiana made products such as cookies from the Sisters of St. Benedict in northern Indiana, Amelia's bread from Indy, pretzels from Tell City, and B.'s Peanut Butter from  Zionsville. The meals-to-go includes a nice variety of healthy salads, and hearty entrees (Turkey Meatloaf with Leek Mash?! Sounds yummers!). \n\nThe location is in a renovated building that has been empty since I've lived here (almost 9 years). It's has a lovely charm about it. I think it's fair to guess there will be outdoor seating in the warmer months. \n\nThe staff was friendly when we approached the register, but as the only customers in the store, no one offered to help us as we looked? I found that a bit odd for a newly opened establishment. I mean, I'm from Indy.... so the market items are familiar to me, but a visitor would just be like 'Oh, another bag of caramel and cheddar popcorn in cool packaging.'

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"We're old fans of the original Pomme which had such a great vibe.  It was not ostentatious, didn't try too hard.  Reliably good AFFORDABLE bistro food.  One of our favorite go-to's.  We never even tried the posher version next door because we so loved Pomme.\nEnter Avenue.  It feels like it was both restaurants put together but it's lost the old Pomme vibe completely.\nThe prices feel, well, pricier most certainly.  But it doesn't feel worth the extra.\nWe brought our daughter there for her 18th bday recently.  The busboy was moving quickly and very loudly.  Chairs dragged across the floor, water slopped on to the chairs and the floor.  It felt rough.  We were placed in a corner by a window that had so much air conditioning pouring down that we moved our chairs around and I stayed wrapped up through the whole meal. Our waiter (bless him, but he had bad breath which is a very awkward thing for someone waiting tables) forgot my drink order completely.  Described a risotto dish to us as not having any shrimp despite it saying so on the menu but \"the kitchen made up for it by adding in more lobster.\"  When the dish showed up, there was shrimp in it.  okay!\nThe famous chocolate mousse that we so loved at Pomme was very grainy tasting.\nWe were all mostly happy with the choice of dinners (risotto, steak, trout) but the ambience just really felt off.  (Very) young man at the front desk who didn't seem all that interested in our visit.  \nJust overall not what we were hoping for on a special evening.","stars":2}

We were seated promptly by a very pleasant staff member and ordered our dinners shortly after. \n\nIt was a decent wait for the food to come out but nothing ridiculous. My only issue with this experience was the portion situation. My margarita de jardin was in a rock glass and although tasty- not worth $10 (I couldn't help but think of the drinks at Ball & Biscuit downtown for phenomenal value at same price). The tacos des papas and its two supporters were certainly delicious, however I felt like I had been cast in a Zoolander film, at a restaurant for ants, due to the tiny tortilla sizes. Overall the entree & drink was not worth $30, but they are on the right track. I recommend larger portions of either the food, beverage, or both to become a local favorite. That said, there is definitely talent at Sangrita. Looking forward to whatever else they serve up.","stars":3}

It had a breakfast-y vibe.  They had a special soup of the day that was outstanding.  I could have that every day!   For our entrees we had the pork chop and the braised beef.  The pork had a nice smokey flavor and was a large portion (especially for the price). The beef was like a pot roast with gnocchi.  Tender with a rich gravy and veggies.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"MEXICAN FOOD EMERGENCY\n\nWorking on the road is not always glamorous for example my day started at 5am with breakfast at a Starbucks in Hammond, Indiana. Fast forward to midnight and I've worked all day without a proper meal. Typically I'm going to go to bed hungry because there aren't many food options on the road past 10pm, unless you want crappy fast food. \n\nI truly love my Yelp app because it's there for me during food emergencies. I'm always using my filters based on my needs. Tonight I used \"Open Now\" which helps me filter through my available food options. I don't need to start reading 5 star reviews about a place that is closed at midnight. That never helps and I just get HANGRY!This place immediately showed up and was only 0.9 miles from my hotel. The best part is they were even open 24\/7 which also gets a lifetime bookmark from me in case of another midnight Mexican Food Emergency. \n\nWhen I drove up I noticed four guys eating inside which is always a good sign. Empty restaurants feel scary. I also noticed the restaurant had a drive thru too which I may use on my next visit. When I went inside my eyes got huge. Everything on the menu looked fantastic. Remember I had Starbucks for breakfast about 19 hours ago. There's a good chance I'm ordering the whole menu board. \n\nI decided to get the Steak Burrito which comes the way I totally love it with just pico de gallo and guacamole. Score! I also added on an order of the chicken enchiladas. While I was waiting for my order to be made the guy at the counter pointed me to the self serve salsa bar! I was so happy to see this. I was carrying out and I packed three salsa verde, two mild red and two hot red salsas. They even provided little lunch baggies just in case you didn't put the lid on right and it opened up on your way home. I call that Salsa Safety! On a side note another Yelper blasted this place for not having any salsa. I feel bad for them because the free self serve salsa was right in the dining room. I'm not sure how you could miss this Mecca of Salsa. I loved both the medium spicy verde and the mild red salsa. \n\nI carried out my food because it's sad to eat alone at midnight plus no one can see you pigging out in your hotel room. The steak burrito was wonderful. This is how I like it. It was so simple. Grilled steak along with fresh guac and pico wrapped in a grilled burrito is the bomb. This is the only way to have it. The chicken in the enchiladas was nice too. The white meat was shredded and moist. The red enchilada sauce was also tasty and rich. I enjoyed the salad on top too. This makes the dish healthy. Right?\n\nI would definitely come back especially for late night food. Was the food here life changing? Nope but it's good Mexican. I throughly enjoyed every bite and it saved me from going to bed or eating at a gas station. Ironically before stopping here I almost bought a ramen bowl at the gas station up the road. I'm honestly glad I didn't because this meal was much better. Desperation truly sets in when your tired and hungry. I'm glad I found this 24\/7 restaurant. I will always visit you at midnight when I'm working in the area. I might even use that drive thru now that I know what to order.","stars":4}

What a great street for them to grow their business! There is plenty of street parking, so no need to walk a great distance to sate your craving.  Their store is a delightful little clean nook where you can watch through a large glass pane as your fresh drink is prepared before your eyes.  They do have a (unisex?) bathroom for Men, Women, and short aliens, as well as WiFi for some light work off your data dime.\nFOOD\/DRINK - This stuff is as good as it gets. Not only are the drinks delicious, but their variety is wide to accommodate event the most discerning of palates. They source as much of their produce (maybe all of it) from local growers and even sell other health-related items like PURE honey, pollen, and handmade soaps. For recommendations, I'd put The Beastess, the Black Magic Berry, and The Refresher atop the \"Must Try\" list.

It's pretty too \n\nOur server, Ana, was friendly and amazing! She provided lots of information on the menu when we had questions & had great recommendations. She even brought us an order of the potatoes (these are a must!!) with our meal to try. We ordered the queso, guacamole, and the ancho salsa  to try. It was way too much for 3 people, but it was all delicious! The guacamole was a perfect preparation of fresh chunky avocados with a little onion & lime. The queso can be made with your choice of items. The Gouda gave it a nice flavor and all the mix-ins blended well. The mild salsa was also a winner. Just enough spice to make it nice! \n\nFor our meals, we shared the Baja Fish tacos & Braised Chicken Enchiladas. Our son had the kids Creamy Mac & Cheese. The fish tacos were a delicious mix of Mahi, what seemed to be a pickled cabbage mix & crema. The enchilada we amazing! I wasn't sure about the diablo sauce but it took these enchiladas to another level. And the kids Mac & Cheese really was a creamy mix of cheese & shell pasta.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"It's the first time flying here, and I suspect it would be the last for a while. Not too keen on flying to those smaller airports where you are not a race car fan at all. I'm not really a fan of the Indianapolis Colts either. But since there's the Indianapolis Marathon coming up, that's why I am here to pick off. The airport itself is nice and small. Smaller than most airports. I got out of the gate area in less than 10 minutes, so that was a plus.  Like most airports, there's signs that guide you to the bag claim and ground transportation.  The airport is clean and refurbished, so you know that it's welcoming. \n\nCan't comment on the baggage claim situation, since I fly light. Especially since the carriers use smaller aircraft flying to these smaller destinations (ie Delta Connection and United Express). Chances are you can't fit a roller board in the overhead bins without some challenge and fight with other passenger's bags. It's fun to see those people struggle with them, especially when they should've known already. Better to be prepared for less stress while flying.\n\nThis airport reminds me of LIT, ABQ, or GEG. Small, tight, and regional. Getting in and out was very good, so that's not a problem anyway. Flew here from a connection on United Airlines from Chicago O Hare. I didn't feel like driving, so I am glad Indianapolis has an airport to fly into. Not too much places to eat here, but then again, it's adequate for what you want. Best advice is to eat before you come to the airport, to spare yourself the high price of airport kiosk food and ultimately on board airline food - unless you are holding a 1st class ticket. There is free wifi, so that's pretty good. IND is your quintessential regional airport, which is good, since the TSA lines are smaller than the larger ones I have already been through.\n\nI really don't bother with the finer details. \n\nJust in and out & onward with my life.\n\nB+","stars":3}

Coming from KC, we weren't too familiar with the St. Charles area but a bunch of guests of the wedding decided to hang out here before the reception.\n\nPrices were extremely reasonable and the food was pretty good. We split a few appetizers at our table, notably the calamari was tasty and not too chewy like I feared it could be. They also had sweet potato french fries. It's hard to mess up fried food but at least the food wasn't greasy and it came out to our table pretty quick. The service was... eh. We were seated right next to the bar so at the beginning we were getting pitchers and other misc drinks from the bartender himself but halfway through our stay, we decided to order food. When we asked the bar if we could order food, we got a pretty nasty: \"You have a waitress\" response from him. He was of no help whatsoever to get us a waitress or even just take our order. Most bartenders are happy to help you out and I'm pretty sure he has a food-function on his register. So that was off-putting. Then when we tried asking our waitress for our check to be added to our bar tab, she said we had to close-out the bar tab and then she can ring us up. Just seems like they could have been a bit more accommodating in consolidating the two. Granted, I understand that two separate people were providing us service, but it seemed really silly to ring us up twice. I feel like this could have been dealt with differently or at least be a bit more patient in explaining rather than playing hot-potato with our business. After closing out tickets on all fronts, we headed out to the patio. The patio area is great! It overlooks a parking lot... and the mighty mo and the weather (though I know not their doing) was just perfect for patio libations.\n\nOverall, a decent experience. For it being right smack in the middle of wedding season, a Saturday afternoon with beautiful weather, the service was speedy.

I unfortunately only mostly  cons here to report\n\nI'll get this out of the way for now: PROs: They were polite at first. And actually very efficient in packing my things for my move while I was there to watch them (see below for further details). \n\nPre Move: They were completely unorganized. I have a number of pieces of glass furniture and repeatedly told them about the sizes and number of items that I had that required crating (this means they would pack the glass items separately and more securely for the move). This was done by a 3rd party person. The 3rd party was great, but he was told I had 1 piece of glass. And had to go out and find more wood to crate only a few of my items. \n\nThey had scheduled a time to come to pick my things up prior to me going to work. And they showed up 3 hours late. I understand that traffic and schedules change, but when I left for work (because they were late and I had to then go and leave them there), my roommate came an hour later and found them DRINKING HIS BEER WHILE MOVING MY STUFF. And their excuse was me saying before I left, if you get hot you can help yourself to drinks in the fridge, I had meant water, soda etc. I didn't realize that United, and Armstrong condoned drinking while on the job. \n\nWhen I got to SC my stuff came late. So the third party movers who were there for mounting my TV and putting together surround sound etc, they were waiting by themselves and then left. My items then came the next day. \n\nEverything had been broken. The boxes were smashed to bits. My dresser was barely able to stand upright. My glass desk was missing pieces. My glass dining table had a cracked base that someone had placed tape over. The estimated cost of everything to replace was around 8000 dollars. My bed had no support beams. Just some wood around it (I had to build a makeshift support for my boxspring and mattress). My bookshelf had the back smashed in because a box went through it. I had missing dining ware, no plates or silverware. \n\nI was furious. I made a claim, because the claim was over 5000, they bumped the claim to United. From here they sent a claims adjuster, who claimed that my dresser, which again i mention COULD NOT STAND UPRIGHT, seemed like it must have been in this condition before I moved it. I'm not sure, how he thought I would agree that I must have just moved trash down from NY, but he seemed to be trying to convince me of that. As usual they did their best to cheapen their deal, which is their job I suppose, but here was the straw that finally broke me. \n\nThey told me I couldn't get rid of any of the broken furniture until the settlement was finished. This process then lasted 2.5 months. I came to a new city, and had to live with broken things until they gave me my settlement. My settlement did not include any of the bigger pieces of furniture, just the small things. \n\nWhen I asked if they could fix the furniture I got no response. Customer service for the company (which you will have to call multiple companies to climb the ladder until you get to Unigroups claim center is lead by a man named Vick. Vick is the guard dog. He refused to let me talk to claims agents, stating that I had to email instead. When I asked to speak to a manager, he refused to put me through instead he made me email as well. It wasn't until I found out his name and the name of his manager did I get anywhere. \n\nI understand that things can happen. But the complete lack of respect for my things in all phases of this really just made this whole process terrible. The lack of coordination in the beginning, the clear damage done and the refusal of responsibility, and then the inability to speak to claims agents, all these are why it seems that United has gotten such horrible ratings on line. And I seem to be just another person who is added to this list. \n\nFinal result: I have gotten about 3000 dollars because of the items they simply lost. 0 dollars for broken furniture that they have made me keep. I will likely be in arbitration (an extended review) in order to get this sorted out, and I am anticipating that I will have to go more of a legal route (which I don't want to but its that or give up). \n\nI really recommend trying to find another company if you can when you move your things. It has been an awful experience.","stars":1}

My friend was staying at the Westin this weekend, so I ended up going back and forth to hang with her via the shuttle. The shuttle is a great service! They take you where you need to go in the city and just call them before 11pm and they will pick you up. I was having too much fun with my friend and missed the last shuttle for the night. ;(\n\nI have to say that I liked my double room MUCH better than my friend's king room at the Westin. \n\nThe bathroom amenities are great and they give you a mat for the shower, not a towel.

Given the fairly limited options around Grand Center, it sounded like a good option - neat twists on your typical American food. \n\nEverybody was pleased with what they ordered - fish tacos with fired tilapia, grilled portabella mushroom veggie sandwich, shrimp and oyster po' boy, etc. I myself ordered the protein frittata with eggs, mild cheese, andouille sausage, bacon, and home fries. The frittata itself was excellent - great flavors and the melted cheese was still warm as it came out of the kitchen. \n\nMy fries were a bit on the small side, but I managed to cope since my entree was so tasty. \n\nThe time between our order and when our food arrived seemed a bit long, and to be fair there were about 10 of us eating. \n\nThere were several other options on the menu I would have liked to try, I'll definitely be stopping by again to see if anything tops their frittata. Most of the lunch entrees are between 7 and 12 dollars. Not Wendy's value menu cheap (which is a guilty pleasure of mine), but still affordable.","stars":4}

I've been back to the New Wendy's a handful of times since it opened and have had to put up with a huge share of niggles: a over-mayonnaised burger, ice-cold coffee, malfunctioning coke machines, and slow service. I'm unlikely to return. The Steak & Shake up the street may have more staying power after all.\n\nIf New Wendy's can fix their \"lipstick on a pig\" situation, I'd be back in a flash as it's really beautiful and friendly inside. In the meantime, though, I'd advise that this joint double down on the fundamentals of fast food restaurant operation: (1) fast, and (2) food.\n\nP.S.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I finally decided to mosey over to the south side restaurant \/ location on my way to Hobby Lobby.  \n\nI was hoping it wasn't going to be overly crowded or chaotic as one reviewer mentioned.  \nThankfully, when we entered, it was not too busy.  \n\nAn employee pointed us in the right direction and explained the ordering process.  \n\nWe were able to order smoothly, pay,  and find a table as we waited for them to call out our number(s).  \n\nI found one critical operational flaw regarding order pick up.  \n\nThe place is fairly large enough, so when people are talking and the noise level is fairly high, I soon realized that I couldn't hear the person call out any numbers; and also my number.  They need a big light up board that customers can watch.   This would be a big bonus considering the fact that they don't carry out the food to the customer.  \nOr,.... how about having somebody that can really bellow LOUDLY like an auctioneer?   That should definitely do it.  \n\nThe food was ready at a reasonable time; not too soon, and not too late.  \nIt was hot and tasty overall. \n\n\nWe ordered :  (rated on a 10 scale) \n\nOnion rings - 9\n\nCole slaw - 7\n\nBeef sandwich - 8\n\nChicken tenders - 7\n\n\nThe onion rings were hot and fresh.  The breading was seasoned nicely and had a light and crunchy texture,.....and more importantly, they were not greasy. \n\nThe cole slaw could have been a bit creamier, but it really had a decent overall flavor - not too sweet.  \n\nThe beef sandwich had a nice flavor.  \nThe tender shredded beef with cheese was served on a super long croissant roll.   \nThey put an adequate amount on the roll.   If I could tweak it a bit, I think it would have been outstanding on a French bread roll and served with au jus too.  Yes indeed.  \n\n\nThe chicken tenders were decent, but they seemed just a bit over cooked. \nThe breading was super hard and crunchy and the chicken was a bit dried and chewy. \n\nI will add that the dipping sauces were nice.  \nI ordered the honey mustard and the chipotle ranch.  \n\nI actually used the chipotle ranch to dip my onion rings in.  \nThumbs up.  \n\nI would consider going again and trying something different.","stars":3}

The owners are very friendly and have given good advice about using items that were new to me. For example, letting me know that the ginormous bag of dried red chiles I bought on my first foray would probably last a lifetime. \"Be careful!\" admonished the owner with a huge grin and slight chuckle. Right on target he was, I'd say. I used two of these beauties in a fairly large pot of vegetable korma, removed them after cooking, and we still had to gulp spoonfuls of raita to survive dinner!\n\nBuying spices in a specialty shop such as Bhaarat can be so much more cost effective than buying those little jars at the supermarket - and it may just be me, but I think they taste better. One cool thing to do is visit World Market - just a bit farther east on 116th in Merchant's Square - and purchase an Indian style spice storage container with mini-spoon for all your ground spices from Bhaarat. \n\nTwo recommendations, apart from the obvious spices and staples you can get here: the pre-cooked and frozen gulab jamun and the Pillsbury frozen naan that is stuffed with paneer (a mild Indian cheese). I don't know how to make either of these by hand yet and I must say the bread especially is really tasty and easy to prepare from the freezer - nice and spicy, too!","stars":4}

The guacamole wasn't to our liking.  It has a funky flavor, someone in our party commented it had a taste of citric acid and not lime juice.

If I'd been able to stand in front of my bowl as it was made, I would've spoken up and asked for more, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. Everything was rushed.

She was going just a mile a minute, seemingly trying to do too many things at once. We inquired about drinks, and she promptly marched off to the host to grab a menu and chastise her for not giving us one. While she was doing that, we found a QR Code for the beverages on the bottom of the food menu and began looking at it that way. They were out of two different beers my husband ordered, and when my Strawberry Lemonata came to the table it was not at all how I remembered it. I asked her if they changed the recipe, and she just shrugged and said \"maybe, a lot of things have changed\". I honestly think she just made it wrong, I mean it wasn't even the right color.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I have never had Peruvian food before Machu Picchu, so I hope you will keep that under consideration.  I went here for lunch with another foodie friend of mine.  We had a really hard time deciding what to order glancing through the menu, the pictures made us want to try a lot of things.  It was a good thing we had our mind set on ordering the ceviche before we even stepped into this place.  I just love the idea of dressing seafood in lime juice and I heard this place had a killer ceviche.  We also decided on the Parihuela de Mariscos Bouillabaisse, the picture looked so enticing with all the seafood falling out of the bowl.  We figure we should get another item since the ceviche was just an appetizer.  We went with the Arroz Chaufa de Mariscos base on it's description \"shrimp, octopus, squid and mussels served with fried rice\", you can never have too much seafood.\n\nAfter putting in our order they brought out the equivalent of bread and butter, but it was actually bread and a bowl of green dipping sauce.  Wow I love this green sauce, it tasted like a concoction of ranch, mayo, and different spices.   I could eat that stuff all day but I had to stop myself since we had more food on the way.  It was good thing I did because the Machu Picchu ceviche(their most popular ceviche) arrived on a huge plate.  The ceviche was quickly followed by the other two items and they were all huge.  Do not think it was huge because of fillers they gave us plenty of proteins.  \n\nLet's get down to the it...the food!  The Ceviche Machu Picchu was excellent.  It was very fresh, light, and flavorful.  I like that they use fresh fish and you can tell the fish was raw and they cooked it with the lime juice.  Again you just cannot believe how much proteins were given to us.  The plate of ceviche was pile and pile of shrimp, squid, octopus, and fish.  They also included 4 large mussels, corn, and sweet potato.  After eating the ceviche with so much kick of lime juice I expected the same from the bouillabaisse.  I was expecting a rich flavorful broth, and I did not get that exactly.  The broth was very simple and a tad salty, but nothing really exciting.  I guess the huge serving of seafood made up for the lack of flavor.  Again I have never had this before so I can't really say it's not authentic but I'm just not a fan of the taste of the broth.  By the time we made it to our last plate we were both extremely full.  We sorta misinterpreted the Arroz Chafa de Mariscos, we thought it was assorted seafood with a SIDE of fried rice.  It turned out to be fried rice with assorted seafood.  We both were not a fan of fried rice to begin with so we did not make a dent at this dish.  However, the fried rice was cooked really well and they gave us a lot of seafood.  \n\nMachu Picchu deserve 4 stars...the ceviche is great, the green dipping sauce is addicting, the portions are huge, and there is no skimming on the proteins.  I went back again wanting to try their roasted chicken but they ran out, must be doing something right.  Will be coming back again and again for sure!","stars":4}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Schnucks' spicy fried chicken and donuts are exactly like Yadier Molina.  You don't expect him to exceed expectations and hit the game winning home run in Game 7 of the NLCS but then he does.  Then you can't get enough of him for the next several years.  Plus he got neck tattoos.  I don't know how that ties into the chicken but it's worth noting.\n\nWhen I lived nearby I used to get their chicken at least once a week it seemed.  Then I hitched a ride on the first boxcar out of St. Louis county bound for St. Louis city.  Soulard to be exact.  The land of opportunity and funky, yet pleasing smells emanating from the brewery.  Now I rarely get their chicken and donuts.  \n\nI don't know if the spicy fried chicken is as drool-inducing at other Schnucks' but it is worth a try.  I think their price is around $8.99 for an 8 piece.  \n\nFat guy tip: When transporting said chicken from Schnucks(or any chickenery) to home, you have to vent the box.  When the steam builds up in the box, moisture forms and makes the chicken soggy.  Soggy fried chicken leads to depression.  Depression leads to impulse purchases from the home shopping network.  I've been there many times.  I own seven shake weights.\n\nOther points of interest:\n-Walk in beer fridge.  Tears will run down your face and then nearly freeze as you enter.\n-Walk in wine fridge.  I've never been.  I'm not classy enough to drink wine...except Boone's Farm.  \n-In house eating area.  I've never tested this out but you can order food, receive the freshly made food, sit down, and eat it...in a grocery store.  Everything I thought I knew about the grocery bidness is wrong.\n\nThis place is more country club than grocery store.  I think there is a fireplace on the second level.

This was her first time ordering one and although what she ordered turned out really tasty, she was a bit bewildered by the numerous steps in ordering. She ordered a dairy milk option, not a tea option.  She ordered a strawberry flavor which was delicious.  And when it came to the boba, she got popping, not the beads.  Since I got to try half her drink, I was quite surprised by the popping since I had never had it before.  I was used to the beads that were more like tapioca\/gum drop chewy.  Instead, as the poppings slid up the straw, they burst with a squirt upon first contact with my teeth.  I found it quite pleasant and the immediate flavor release was also pleasing.  I found the ordering menu on one end of the stall,so a second one would be beneficial in case customers were blocking the view of the options.\nThese beverages are more expensive than sodas or iced teas, so keep that in mind if you are ordering a double digit sandwich for lunch.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I love the new remodel.  Makes you feel all fancy and stuff when you eat there. We went on a sunday afternoon at about 4:30pm and sat on the patio on a beautiful day.  Bear in mind I work late shift and I love breakfast foods but most every other brunch spot was closed.  I've eaten here and some of the sister stores several times in the past and always have a good experience so i knew this was a safe bet.  Their omelettes are very good, the broken yolk sandwiches are popular.  This time I was torn between breakfast and trying some of their newer stuff.  I ordered the tomato asparagus soup.  It was really good, but not great, and I will try a different soup next time.  As I mentioned I was really torn on what to get.  I literally ordered each course as I went a long.  We also had the pomme frites  aka french fries as an appetizer.  The soup and frites came quickly and kept me from slipping into a hunger rage and let me decide with a reasonable thought process how to proceed.  My girlfriend and I then split a Croque Madame based on other Yelp reviews.  It was awesome.  You may be thinking what the heck is Croque Madame. It's a very delicious, very filling, adult spin on a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with an over easy egg on top to cut into and cover the sandwich with yolky goodness. I highly, I repeat, HIGHLY recommend this.  Friggin awesome.  We also ordered a sweet crepe which had ricotta cheese, honey, and nuts.  It was good but i think we both were really wanting the Harrison Crepe with the chocolate ganache and creme.","stars":5}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"If not for the rudeness of Avery P I would give this new venue 5 stars. First, the good. Beer is great and varied. We had the Kung Pao wings and the brewskie juicy burger which comes with the pomme frites. Wings were cooked to perfection and full of spicy flavorful sauce. The burger was juicy and oozing with pub cheese between 2 5 oz patties with homemade pickles! Fabulous flavor. Now back to the server...when my friend inquired about the meat of the hot dogs, Avery had no idea and didn't bother to offer to check with someone. Then we asked if any sauce came with the fries (as several are listed on the menu) she said \"well you didn't ask for any. \" \nAfter the shift change, we asked the new server about the meats and he knew which was made of veal, beef, etc. We enjoyed our visit and experience and will return eager to try the varied menu!","stars":4}
{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Despite the good reviews, I don't know why I kept passing on Bakersfield. I finally got my act together and checked out Bakersfield for dinner. Once I got there & saw the menu, I couldn't shake why everything looked so familiar. Then, I realized that I've been to Bakersfield in Nashville! I had a really good experience there, so I was looking forward to a similar experience. You won't find any street tacos here - catina style 100% \n\nWe started off with chips, salsa & guac. My favorite was the rojo salsa - nice and smoky. The guac was good, but it's not the best. This is not Bakersfield's fault because I know it's the weird avocados in the midwest. Just trust me, it's not the same as a California avo. \n\nLike in Nashville, I got the fish (crispy hake, tabasco lime sauce, citrus slaw, cilantro), hongos (portobello, poblano, fresno, bell pepper, kale slaw, cotija cheese), and huitlacoche (corn truffles, roasted poblano, corn, onion, cotija cheese, cilantro) tacos. I also always pay the extra dollar for house pickled jalape\u00f1os. \n\nWhen served, I could immediately see and smell the pungent cotija. Yum. Fish and hongos were great! The huitlacoche was fine - tasty but not as tasty. It's a good vegetarian option though! I think I thought the same exact thing last time in Nashville too. I never learn, ha. \n\nMy boyfriend got the Cubano Torta (beer braised carnitas, chorizo, red cabbage, black beans, pickled peppers, monterey jack, poblano dijonnaise). He seemed to thoroughly enjoy it and even took the other half home. The sauce it came with was fantastic - it was like a latino spin on a carolina bbq sauce - it was super vinegary and flavorful. \n\nWe unfortunately had to rush through dinner for an obligation, but the server (in training) was fantastic! She knew the menu well and was a natural. \n\n115\/365","stars":4}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Came to this location because I had been experiencing some issues with my left eye. I'm a contract wearer that does not do well taking care of them. I was already due for an eye exam. I made an appointment, which they were professional and flexible in doing so. \n\nWhen I got there, I was greeted by two workers on the floor. They helped me check in and watch for the doctor. In the meantime, I check out frames that they had on display. They had some cool brands such as DKNY and Coach. While trying a few frames on, the doctor called my name to come into her office. \n\nThe doctor was very nice and conducting her tests on my eyes. She took her time to listen to me and my health concerns about my eyes. She informed me I was having some dryness issues and ordered me to rest my contacts for a week. She wanted a follow up appointment for the following week. \n\nI came back that following week and the doctor saw improvements. I was very impressed that she was able to help me correct the issues. It appears my issues were caused  not only by dryness, but also by a wrong prescription I received 2 years ago in Chicago. Since I have received the doctor's services, my eyes are doing much better (no major dryness, no veins jumping, etc.)\n\nThe staff was very helpful! The general manager was very friendly and checked on me to ensure I was being taken care of. The receptionist was professional. I liked that they did not push me to use the rest of my HSA at their store. I really liked some purple DKNY frames, and buying them with my 6 months supply of contacts would have maxed out my HSA. But I knew even thought they were really cute, I hardly wear glasses. So they said OK and sold me the contacts. I appreciate the suggestion to buy the glasses, but not being pushed to be oversold. \n\nI will go to the location again for my eye care needs, even thought the Greenwood location is closer. I just received better service and care at this location.","stars":5}

I call or stop in  and they state they will put me at the top of the priority list, then never hear from them even after leaving messages sometimes 2-3months. Right now I am awaiting fixing a decal issue that I was promised would be dealt with immediately... one month tomorrow without an appointment scheduled to get it fixed (for the 3rd time might I ad.) As for initial sales, they change around numbers and play the shell game. I started taking pics of their offers each time and they would disappear and come back with new supposedly better deal, but it was only rearranging the numbers as the monthly payment would go up. When I caught them and showed them the pics they said it was a computer error. Found one upstanding guy who took all the quotes from each time they gave us the numbers and honored them all so we got a great price only by their mistake! But service since them is horrible! Buyer beware. I would love to contact the owner and make him aware of the 20+ trips I have made to his dealership to deal with all the issues. Supposedly two employees have been let go due to issues with my car and not dealing with issues - I however doubt that was the issue.

Now, I don't need my name on a wall to claim that status, and an attempt to sample ALL of Growlers' beers is a rich man's folly, but I am strongly in favor of the Club nonetheless.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I drove out to Indy today for no particular reason.  After walking around downtown and checking out the mall, I stopped in here for dinner tonight.  I was alone but the staff was welcoming.  \nThe service here really is top notch and the d\u00e9cor is classy.  The 2 stars is for the prices and what you get for the price. \nI had a glass of white wine for $11 which is fine.  That's typical for a glass of wine. \nI ordered a crab cake as an appetizer.  I received 1 crab cake for $18.  For that price for 1 crab cake, I should have been blown away by it but I wasn't.  \nEntr\u00e9e was 6 oz. filet mignon for $35.  The filet, as well as pretty much all of their entrees, doesn't come with anything.  No salad, soup, sides, nothing.  They didn't even have any bearnaise sauce for it.  Usually a filet mignon is a round cut of meat but this was shaped more like a steak.  It was cooked the way I ordered it but it wasn't really even close to the best filet mignon I've ever had.  \nSince the filet didn't come with any sides I went ahead and added an order of squash.  $15. \nThe squash really was good but not $15 kind of good.  \nDessert?  But of course.  Tiramisu for $10.  I like tiramisu I didn't particularly care for this one.\nFinal tally before tip - $97.  \nFor $97 for dinner for 1 person, I should have been blown away by something but I wasn't.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"Although my wife and I enjoy trying new restaurants and bars, I don't think we fit the target customer well for the Saint Shack because we are older.  The food and cocktails we tried were tasty and reasonably priced.  The hostess who greeted us was friendly too.  Located on the west side of Meridian Street between the mall and the Slippery Noodle restaurants, you can pay to park in the mall or use the metered parking along Meridian if you are able to find a sot. Fortunately, we went early and grabbed a spot right in front of the bar.  The Saint Shack is located on the street level and because of that, I was approached by someone asking for cash even before I got inside the bar.  That happens way too often near the Fieldhouse  anymore.\n Inside, even after just opening, the music was thumping loudly which I guess is okay if you are here to mingle and like the music style, but if you are there to grab a bite to eat and talk with friends, it becomes a bit more difficult.  The  volume caused the bar tenders to shout loudly which was distracting while my wife and I ate. One of the bar tenders has a very shrill and piercing laugh that was off putting to hear throughout our meal. I'd say the frozen slushies were the most appealing part of our experience.  No waiting to be served at the bar.  The hostess got them for us and even took our food order, so we rarely saw any wait staff throughout the meal, though our food made it to our table in relatively little time.  Don't expect a glass of water ;with your meal or follow up attention. Fortunately, the food is served in boxes you can use for \"to go\".  It did okay for a bar, but service wasn't quite at restaurant level.  \nMy wife enjoyed her Indy dog, but  passed on the jalapenos.  I ordered a regular corn dog after my attempt to order an andoullie corndog failed. I also placed an order for tots (crispy and plentiful. Finally, I ordered Boudin Balls (4 per order).  These were coated with crispy crumbs and served with a spicy brown mustard to add a bit of heat flavor.  Since these meatballs are made with crumbs inside to help keep the sausage from becoming tough and binding, they tend to break apart quite easily which made dipping them a little messy.  \n\nOne of the things I failed to find was a way from the restaurant area down to the bar in the basement without having to go outside to the front of the bar.  Seems the mgmt should have addressed this during he build out.  If here is a way downstairs, it definitely needs better marking for patrons to find.  I understand that these may be two separate bars, but are decorated like they are one.  JUust a little more confusion.\n\nWell, if you are a fan of frozen\/slushie type cocktails, swing by here and give them a try.  We really enjoyed the ones we tied.  \n\nReview #3954","stars":4}

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"I purchased a Groupon to try this place - I wouldn't have heard of it otherwise - and was very excited about eating there.\n\nMy son and I arrived at 6:00pm, and there were two other occupied tables. We were seeing a movie, nearby, at 7:15, and thought an hour would be plenty of time to get a couple of sushi rolls. \n\nWe ordered soups, and appetizer and three rolls, all at the same time. The miso soup and goyza came out pretty promptly, and they were okay. Our server never came back to the table, though.\n\nAt 6:30, our sushi still wasn't ready, so we decided to get it to go. We flagged down the server, and explained the situation. She said okay, and hurried off. \n\nTwenty minutes later, she hadn't returned to the table - i figured she'd have at least brought us our check, cleared our soup and app plates, or something. My son went to go get the car, and I flagged her down again. I told her I wanted to pay for what we had eaten, and that we had to leave.\n\n\"So you want me to take the sushi rolls off of your tab?,\" she asked.\n\n\"Well, have they made them yet? If they're ready, I'll take them with me.\" I replied.\n\n\"No, the sushi bar is really backed up.,\" she said.\n\n\"Then, no, I don't want to pay for them. Just the appetizers and beverages, please.\"\n\nShe huffed, and walked off to get the owner. The owner okayed it, but then turned to me and said I should have told the server I was in a hurry. I explained that I had, half an hour ago, and he apologized. \n\nMy Groupon was only good for dine-in entrees, though, so I paid $24 out-of-pocket.\n\nBTW, during this exchange, a family that came in fifteen minutes after we did, had finished their meal, and were leaving. \n\nNot impressed.","stars":2}

There have been two instances where they have completed my order incorrectly, one time by completely forgetting to add my soup in my bag.  They did make it up by giving me a gift-card for the troubles which easily made up for the mistake.

{"region":"MIDWEST","text":"My favorite dining experience while I was in Indianapolis. If you're still there while it's warm, see if you can catch a little bit of outside dining while the weather is nice although it's also very quite lovely inside. Bluebeard does not take reservations, but the restaurant is pretty huge if you factor in both indoor and outdoor seating. One of the big mysteries of life is how they keep their food so high quality, while serving so many people at once. Perhaps we'll never know.\n\nThe menu changes everyday, so if you come here often; don't get too attached to the dishes, instead start embracing the change and high quality farm-to-table meals which are best ordered to share. The menu is super cute, being split up into several sections: \"small plates, middle plates and large plates\" along with a section for snacks, cheeses, sides & soups and salads.\n\nI started an order off with a roasted beet salad, pickled mackerel and delicious octopus. Each bite was memorable with the octopus arriving first with a flair of a presentation. Decorated with radishes, cucumbers, tobiko, wakame and jalapenos, each bite had a variety of balanced flavors going on. It wasn't overwhelming with one particular one sticking out, but dressed the octopus well which was delicious and fresh.\n\nThe roasted beet salad was an excellent summer fresh lighter fair. We shared a small portion and thought that it was more than enough to get a nice taste of it. The salad was inventive (something you'll see a lot of here) and delicious. Served with goat cheese, pistachios, fennel, apple and a champagne vinaigrette; it was the perfect summer starter (but hey, it's already Fall!). The pickled mackerel was also delicious: if you're a fan of pickled fish (which I grew up with in Russia), it's a very comforting, simple yet delicious sandwich.\n\nMy main course was a \"middle plate\" of Udon Ramen which was served with shrimp sausage (something I've never had before), country ham, watermelon radish, napa cabbage, basil, jalapeno and a very intense unami broth. The ramen was done very well, but to nitpick a little I thought the amount of broth : noodle ratio was off. More broth would have been appreciated given the amount of udon in the dish. I didn't think the country ham was a great fit to float around with all the other flavors, but it was a bold choice on the part of the chef. I just thought it added a little bit of too much sodium to an already salty-dish (better to balance it with something less salty, IMO). Nitpicking apart, the broth was incredible with very many flavors. The shrimp sausage was interesting and tasty and the plate was filling.\n\nFor dessert, we shared half of a french press and ordered the poached pear dumplings. This was phenomenal! It was a pear, wrapped and baked up with a small amount of flavor and a delicious maple-y (not quite sure what it was) top. Think of what you would get on top of a peach cobbler perhaps. The dessert was the perfect finish to a fantastic meal. Indy is lucky to have so many farm-to-table restaurants. Bluebeard needs to be at the top of your list!","stars":5}

Sometimes I get in the mood for Mexican and this is a place that can satisfy that. \n\nThey also have a large bar area and occasionally bring in a DJ for all you guys looking for a fiesta!\n\nMexican lunch buffet as well. Best to go early before they slow down and the buffet stock gets old, but it's usually good.\n\nNot much to report other than this is a solid place I'll definitely continue to frequent.","stars":3}
