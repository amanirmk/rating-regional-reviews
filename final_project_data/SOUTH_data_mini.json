{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This is a fine Italian restaurant with excellent service (and a good sense of humor!), delightful ambiance, and delicious food.  Spouse and I both started with a house salad, dressed delectably in a creamy Italian\/Caesar dressing.  A basket of warm crusty bread was provided along with butter as well as seasoned olive oil for dipping.  For entr\u00e9e, I ordered a daily special of roast leg of lamb which was beautifully prepared, and 'fall-off-the-bone' tender.  This was accompanied by a side of linguine in Carino's wonderful tomato sauce.  Spouse selected eggplant parmesan with a side of penne and enjoyed it very much.  My entr\u00e9e was a very generous portion and I took about half the lamb and half the linguini home.  The house chianti and pinot grigio were perfect.  We were too full to consider dessert.  Highly recommended.","stars":5}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Einstein said: \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\". I sometimes think of this when I refuse to learn my lesson about certain things, such as eating a seaweed salad with chopsticks in the car or continually eating at tapas places, even though I know I don't like tapas.\n\nWhy am I always disappointed by tapas? Pure selfishness. I don't like applying a communal aspect to an already tiny plate. It stresses me out to see my minuscule rations being passed around the table, knowing that while I did get the first bite, that is probably all I'll get. Yet, even when it's just Max and I, we usually leave renewing our agreement to not eat at any more tapas places. Three olives and some low-grade manchego do not a meal make.\n\nBut one day I discovered Old Metairie Road and was charmed by a strip of restaurants that look like a glimpse into the 40's, one of those restaurants being Vega Tapas. Since Max doesn't share my weakness for breaking promises made to one's self, I had to enlist Anna to go with me for a weekday lunch.\n\nEven though we got there five minutes before closing and were the only table, the waiter was ridiculously accommodating. I was thrilled to see a carp roe \"caviar\" dip on the menu in place of the same old boring hummus dip I expected to see. But I was overjoyed when the dip was delivered with an assortment of accoutrements including capers, onions, and two kinds of unknown cheeses, as well as warm, grilled pita bread. Grilled bread in any form makes me giddy.\n\nI was further titillated by the mention of house made duck sausage. I believe there are certain red flags that signal a restaurant is quality. One of those flags is house made sausage.\n\nAnyhow, because of this predilection, I had to order the special of duck sausage with black-eyed peas cooked with pancetta. A little gluttonous for a weekday lunch but there you have it. I won't say the sausage was great, but it was good. More so the black-eyed peas were wickedly smoky and delicious.\n\nAlthough I certainly haven't tried the gauntlet of food at Vega, so far I'm impressed, meaning I might have to forget about my pledge to discontinue tapas.\n\nFor more of my reviews of Nola cuisine, visit my blog: http:\/\/eatdrinknola.blogspot.com","stars":4}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Had a great experience getting my tragus pierced by Monique! Wandered in around 8pm and there was no wait, and no appointment was necessary (for a Sunday evening). Monique showed me all the options and explained everything to be very clearly, which was much appreciated as I was *a little* nervous. Throughout the whole process she spoke very calmly (she has a very soothing voice), which helped me to feel at ease and comfortable. The great thing about this shop is that you 100% know how sterile everything is because they show you the approval tag from the autoclave before they even start. She also draped my ear as if a medical procedure were to be performed, so it was definitely clean. In addition, I had a double helix that I had gotten pierced earlier in the month, and she offered to shorten the posts for me since the swelling was finished (however, this is an added cost, just FYI). She also recommended to come back in two weeks so she could just check on how the healing is going; I really appreciate the follow-through!\n\nThe shop itself is very nice, and features local artists on all the walls. \n\nThanks Purity!","stars":5}

I grabbed a few salsas to bring home to put in top of the tacos.\n\nIt's located in the old taco tico and I am not sure if I would have ever stopped without this nudge from yelp.\n\nTacos are $2.50 each or 5 for $10. They also have speciality meals. I'm looking forward to tasting the paco taco - an angus rib-eye taco. \n\nIf you are in the Metairie area you NEED to stop here. The tacos traveled well (about 10 minutes) which is super important during this pandemic.","stars":5}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This review is based solely on food.. have not experienced their brewhouse offerings.\n\nAt first I totally loved this place. It's really quite nice inside. I love that they offer chicken lettuce wraps for the carb-conscious diners. They have an awesome selection of small bite appetizers for 3 dollars!! And the portions for those items are actually quite generous. Most restaurants don't do this. The tomato mozzarella salad was so amazing. The menu is quite a lot to digest. \n\nTheir in-house made sodas are AMAZING!!! Especially the root beer and the orange cream. I don't drink soda, but I downed that orange cream like nobody's biznazzzz. (Beware of the black cherry.. I didn't personally try it but our server claimed it tastes like Robitussin.)\n\nLast time I came here, though, I was a bit disappointed. But disclaimer.. they are known for their pizzas. I did not order a pizza. So maybe one ought to stick to the specialty item. I had some pasta chicken and the chicken kinda tasted like some frozen crap meat... similar to Olive Garden's chicken. No thank you. \n\nAlso tried their famous Pizookie, a decent sized cookie in a pizza pan, soft and gooey with ice cream on top. Look folks, I'm half Jewish, but there's nothing \"halfsies\" about the sweet tooth I inherited. I live for cookies. Especially warm gooey cookies. But this chocolate chip dessert was even too sweet for me. Just too artificial and not enough home baked goodness. Same with the vanilla ice cream on top.. It was very artificial tasting. I don't know how else to describe it. You can taste the difference between a Haagen Daaz vanilla bean and this frozen garbage. I don't mean to be so harsh.. but for something they are apparently well known for, I was incredibly disappointed.\n\nOn a plus side, I sampled the chicken bacon ranch pizza and it was totally delicious. I usually can't stand non-traditional flavored pizzas, but they knocked this out of the park.\n\nAlso the service has always been absolutely superb! Thank you to James for your very knowledgeable recommendations. \n\nI will be back again.. for pizza and appetizers only!

The atmosphere is classy without being ostentatious, and there is no dress code but wearing business casual clothing is common. The boyfriend ordered the fixed price menu for the evening: shrimp and grits, redfish, and pecan pie. I got the small plate size of hotpot and a side of brussel sprouts. The shrimp and grits came first and were fabulous, with the shrimp perfectly cooked in a flavorful sauce atop the mound of appropriately seasoned grits. The boyfriend had had some shrimp and grits from a lesser establishment earlier in the day and remarked that this was \"not the same animal\" that he had been served then. He also thoroughly enjoyed the redfish, although I cannot comment on it too much as it was not shared. The hot pot was a good assortment of seafood in a mild but pungent thai-style coconut curry broth. It was messy but worth looking undignified in front of people, so delicious it was. The brussel sprouts were our favorite dish of the evening. We both love duck and brussel sprouts, and to have them brought together in such a rich and smoky representation was an experience I will not soon forget. The pecan pie was a chocolate pecan pie. The top was a bit hard, and the crust was just good. The inside was caramelized and delicious. It was my least favorite menu item that we tried.

Both this visit and last visit I sat at the bar for a (hopefully) quick lunch.  Last visit it took forever for just my chili & salad lunch to come out (the manager had to finally go get it), but this visit was quicker.\n\nThe bartender was friendly and had chips, salsa and tea out to me in no time, although seemed surprised that I wanted a napkin when the chips came out.  I went with one of their Lunch Combos, so I started with the Southwest Chicken Soup, followed by the Bacon Avocado Chicken Sandwich served with french fries.  \n\nEverything was good - soup had a little bit of a kick to it, and it was a nice piece of chicken on the pretzel roll bun.  I do wish the cheese had been slightly melted before going on top of the chicken though, instead of thrown on top as an afterthought.  And apparently they forgot to put the avocado on the sandwich, oh well.\n\nTheir salsa is addicting, but their chips were under-cooked and very greasy - both this visit and last, which is really disappointing to me.  I had hoped last time was just a bad batch, but I guess greasy is the new norm.\n\nBottom line - good basic food that will satisfy your hunger for a reasonable price.","stars":3}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I am from the area, but just recently visited for the first time when my mom forced me to go with her. I was reluctant, but I am so glad I went...Big Cat Rescue is amazing! \n\nWe had an intern lead our tour and she was great. She was friendly and so knowledgeable about each individual cat. She told us about each cats history and fun facts about some of the cats and their breeds. Some reviews talk about feeling rushed on the tour which was not the case at all with my tour. In fact, at one point she had moved on from a cage that the cat was in his den when the back half of the group stopped to view the cat that had suddenly emerged and the guide actually turned around, came back, and gave us the story on that cat. \n\nLike some of the other reviewers said, I think it is great that they are open about the mistakes they've made in the past. BCR started when the founder was at a auction and saw a bobcat kitten go up for auction and the guy next to her was a taxidermist and was bidding on the kitten to stuff and sell...so she bid and kept it as a pet which is exactly what they are fighting against right now. They also bred some of their cats in the 90's because they thought they were preserving the breeds...but they have learned from these mistake and now actively fight against these wrongful ways and treatments of cats. I love how they end the tour with \"our goal is to one day be shut down because cats will be left in the wild where they belong and a sanctuary\/rescue will not be needed\".\n\nI thought, even though it is a sanctuary, that I would be sad seeing the cats in captivity...but the cages are very nicely done. Obviously the most ideal situation would be for these animals to be in the wild, but that is just not an option for these cats. I also thought (like some reviewers) that the cages seemed smaller than expected, but after asking our guide she showed us just how large the cages are. Several cages (\"rooms\" as they call them) are attached by a tunnel and actually make up 1 cage. So while it appears the cages aren't as big as expected, if you look close you will see they are plenty big. And that also explains why people think some cages are empty...because I thought so too! It was actually just another \"room\" of a cage.\n\nWe were very lucky and saw quite a few cats. If you do the 3:00 tour it ends right before their dinner time starts so you really see a lot of cats towards the end because they are getting ready for supper! We even got to see the Sand Cat which I guess is rare!\n\nBut I highly recommend going and supporting this place!

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"My wife and I are staying at the Omni Royal which has wonderful. The staff has been super friendly and the rooms are awesome. The restaurant attached to the hotel however has been less than subpar and after having paid for another expensive meal that is completely \"meh\" I felt like I needed to write a review. Let me start by saying that we purchased a \"breakfast included\" package and as such we've eaten at the Rib Room 3x and have ordered room service twice in the afternoons. Shame on us for thinking it would get better. The breakfast offering each day has been boring and bland. We've ordered off of the menu and the buffet to try different things and each time the food was on par with something you could buy (or wouldn't) at a convenience store such as scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon that has sat aloud much too long. We've come at different times so it's not like we were the last to eat. This morning's breakfast however won the prize. I ordered the steak and eggs (poached) and as I began cutting into the steak, I noticed small hairs on the plate. I also found a larger hair under my eggs. Before I called the waiter over, I wanted to make sure that the hair was not mine because I was so hungry. I verified that the hair was a different length and slightly lighter than mine. The waiter (who was awesome) seemed really embarrassed and his manager came over. I was grateful for the gesture but the manager could not have been more pretentious when he suggested that the hair was mine. That's where he lost me because all I wanted to do was eat my breakfast. He did offer me the buffet but the previous mornings memory I'd dried scrambled eggs and prune like sausage did not seem like a good compromise. \n\nMy last experience occurred in the afternoon and we decided to order a little room service during the SuperBowl. We ordered the BBQ Shrimp, Buffalo wings, a Caesar Salad and French Onion Soup. The French Onion Soup tasted like it came out of a box and the rest of the food was what you could get at any bar in America for less than a third of the price. I guess that's why I'm so unimpressed and a little frustrated. \n\nNew Orleans has AMAZING food and during our stay here we have had some incredible meals. In fact, our only bad food experience has been at the Rib Room. What makes it worse is that you pay so much more for it. If you only pay $5 - $10 for something and it tastes like crap, then so be it. But if you pay 10x that amount, you expect it to at least have a certain level of execution. Nothing about the food at the RibRoom is special or unique. You could get it anywhere and forget about it later. It's really unfortunate because we have loved staying at the Omni Royal but we recommend eating somewhere else.","stars":2}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I'm not sure whether to be happy or sad for the animals at this sanctuary.  The concept is a good one, and all the volunteers seemed passionate about the animals and about providing good care for them.  On the other hand the animals are kept in cages which seem small and restrictive.  I am NOT an expert on primates but it seems to me the animals are simply existing, and nothing more.  \n\nThere are quite a few primates, there are also turtles and alligators. The facility is not large and you can probably see everything in less than an hour. When we were there, volunteers were carrying around a small alligator letting the guests look and touch it. \n\nThey sell food that you can give to the animals and I believe they sell drinks for the customers but if you are going to be hungry you should bring your own food. There are several picnic benches inside where you can sit and eat.\n\nThe facility is in need of updating, the volunteers are good people passionate about the cause, and the intent is certainly honorable.  If I am honest I have to say that I felt sad for the animals when I left.\n\n I probably won't go back but if you are in the area it is probably worth stopping in and checking it out.","stars":3}

With that said the isles could be a bit more organized.

Moreover, they are consistent, as at least a dozen times I have dined there and been completely happy.  The Owner\/Operator Chris is a pleasant and sincere person who keeps this location, their chefs, and servers in tip top shape!  My experience here compares with sub par steaks at Outback and at Carrabba's that were more expensive, stingy, flat, dry, unappetizing disappointments. The juices here flow amply from my Flatiron Steak, a cut that is in my price range, and that I highly recommend. I can only imagine how good the higher priced ones are!  Not only that, but at dinner you receive a choice of side AND a salad for no extra charge. The atmosphere is dark, intimate, woodsy, like I expect a genuine steakhouse to be. Most recent visit 4-2-19.\n\nI only have one word of caution. If you are dining, do NOT sit at the bar.  It's not the bartender's fault, but he has too many people to serve and was swamped when I stopped there in May. But get this--I left the bar and asked the front person to sit me at a table instead because I sat at the bar for over 10 minutes completely ignored. He sat me at the small, cramped row of booths just to the side of the bar--which was only served by.......the same absentee bartender!! I had to chew out the idiot teenager who sat me there. Finally seated at a proper table, everything else went splendidly. I will be back and back.","stars":4}

Usually when my husband says want Salsas I am totally up for it. Lately, not so much. Sorry guys, the imitation crab meat in the crab quesadilla was probably the final straw to keep me away. I told the server when he FINALLY came back to the table I told him it was fake crab and he said Oh well! Really? The menu states blue crab.......I wouldn't have ordered a crab quesadilla with FAKE meat! The queso is just melted white cheese without seasonings or anything. It is just queso not a mexican cheese dip or anything. That is what it is but the service lacking and the fake meat have really driven me away from here.","stars":2}

They don't try to sell you a bunch of stuff you don't need nor do they try to swindle you out of money.

I was told that it may be due to needing a new battery since somehow the battery swells when old which presses onto the trackpad. Well, I now have a new battery and my mousepad is still acting crazy. I hate to complain because honestly, the guy was just trying to save me unnecessary money. Instead of giving me all these things I wanted, they truly were focused on providing what they thought I needed, which is exactly the kind of place I want to go. They don't pressure you, speak a bunch of fancy words you don't know and they don't try to take your money. The workers here have the absolute best intentions. Unfortunately, it didn't work in this case and my track pad is still not working correctly!\n\n- When I got home, my computer was acting funky and would not connect wi-fi. I had to literally restart my computer 4 times and play with my settings for it to finally pick up on the internet and stop acting weird (weird in a way I've never experienced before as it was asking to connect to certain programs). I'm not very tech-savy but perhaps they changed a setting and forgot to turn it off? It was frustrating nonetheless.\n\nWould I recommend this place?

We sat outside on another ungodly hot day here in Florida. There was a slight breeze and plenty of outdoor fans to help keep us cool. We sipped cheap beers and enjoyed some Dark & Stormy's. We found ourselves a little hungry, so we ordered a dinner platter of Coconut Shrimp, which came with French Fries on the side. The appetizer of shrimp comes with 5 and for only $1 more, they give you fries. It's kind of a no brainer. Let me tell you, they were DELICIOUS!! 6 drinks and food came to about $47. Not bad!!! Afterwards we took a little walk through the harbor. All in all, a positive experience. I would return!!","stars":4}

It was a comfortable place to sit, order a drink, and grab some food to take home to the family.  However, things seemed to change about a year ago.  The first time, they screwed up an order.  The second time, they screwed up an order and the quality seemed to have gone down.  I gave it about six months, and went back today.  It took about 20 minutes to get ONE to-go burrito, and sure enough, I got home and saw that I was overcharged (ordered super burrito and was served a regular).\n\nI understand that things change, but I really just feel stupid for generously tipping much more than the average clientele at this establishment and being treated like my dollar doesn't matter.","stars":1}

I'd never had a lobster roll before and  was greatly disappointed. I guess I assumed there would be more mayo and or flavor. I found it very bland. The shoestring fries were tasty and the kale salad was fIne. This place is pricey and the portions very small. The menu stated a five dollar addition if you split a plate.  Fortunately tthey did not charge us . I simply don't understand why you pay   extra to share something. I wouldn't tell someone to not come here....

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"After dealing with confusion on my reservation at the front desk, I was welcomed into a less than welcoming, dark, hotel room. The pee pad on the bed was beyond uncomfortable, for everytime I moved, it folded below me. But this is not the worst. At 30 weeks pregnant, I would assume a hotel would remove a guest that is smoking marijuana in the room next to me so frequently that my room and hallway are saturated with smoke. For 5 nights. They offered to move me, but not the offending guest. Me- who is 30 weeks pregnant, not able to lift my suitcase, and is also staying at the hotel for a week. I am also a part of a large company who has rented roughly 150 rooms and meeting space from le meridian and who will not ever use this space ever again. After telling em the offending guest was checking out, and him (I know it was a him since he was up until 5 am with friends, smoking marijuana, and the walls are paper thin) continuing to stay, no one remedied this. So, after a 14 hour work day, I am welcomed to my room by this. After complaining 3 times, I get offered a cheese tray that I can't even eat because I am in work meetings AT THE HOTEL with no spare time to sit and eat a cheese plate that has been sitting unrefrigerated for who knows how long.  The management and staff here are beyond defunct. I am an SPG credit card holder and member, and I will be changing all loyalty to a company that takes illegal (federal and state) activities seriously and who protects women and unborn children who are dealing with these illegal activities.

Way too over seasoned. After sending back our crawfish twice and speaking with the manager (who was very hospitable), we came to find out the establishment is owned by a Vietnamese couple that cooks their food with a Vietnamese flare. Crawfish is perfect cooked the good ole fashioned Cajun way. Adding all those extra spices is unnecessary and ruins the food. My girlfriend ended up getting snow crab legs cooked plain in fear that they would cook those a Vietnamese way too. They were plain, hard to crack and have had much better snow crab legs elsewhere. I stuck with the crawfish which I must say again were over spiced and left me feeling sick to the stomach the rest of the evening. The service was terrible from our waitress who rarely came to our table. I had to hunt her down several times to get silverware after our very long wait to get our food, then water refill as well as condiments and napkins.

For the cost of staying here you can't beat the value especially so close to the beach. Parking is free here which is why we chose this hotel over Clearwater Beach. I will say if you're bothered by noise you should ask for a room on the opposite side of the street, as we could hear sirens from the fifth floor facing the street. We asked but they said all of the two bedroom suites faced the street. Even so I still recommend this hotel and would stay here again.","stars":5}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Would have given five stars for a great meal. Minus three for the absolute imbecilic valet service, which was so abysmal on a Monday night that I had to post. After the one valet on duty finished his break and sauntered over, he proceeded to make sure the woman with the G5 Mercedes in line after me got her car first. Even before he picked up her car, we mentioned we had been in line waiting by the valet stand while he had been on break and then tipped generously in advance, but I guess the appeal of a bigger tip from the other group was enticing enough that he serviced them first. When he finally reversed my car up to the stand at breakneck speed, while we're all standing aghast at the terrible service, he snidely asks: \"Is this your car?\"\n\nUm... what am I supposed to say? \"Yes, that's my Lexus... were you not sure? Should I get in and confirm first while it's still running?\" When we pointed out the queue again, he said he had \"mixed the keys up.\" Really, not exactly an encouraging experience overall -- does this kid even know the keys to what car he's handing over? \n\nIf Salt Rock can't do better with the valet I don't honestly see how to justify going back. Not worth it, even for a great meal, when there are so many great steak and seafood restaurants around.

Though I haven't had much Ethiopian food in my lifetime, Cafe Abyssinia certainly makes me want it more.\nThe beet salad was beautiful, tasty, and fresh. Our party of four ordered the veggie combo, lamb yebeg tibs, and chicken doro wat, all of which we polished off happy and full as can be. The veggie combo was good, though I am not quite sure on any particular dishes within it because it wasn't specified. It did, however, come with the beet salad, but you should still order the beet salad as an appetizer all on its own because of how good it is. The yebeg tibs was amazing. The lamb was tender and flavorful, with many pieces still on the bone. The chicken doro wat was aromatic and delicious and came with some sort of cheese and hard boiled eggs--very good.\nThe waitress--though a little quirky and weird--made some good food suggestions like steering us clear of the yebeg alicha fitfit, which she described as something seriously traditional, requiring an acquired taste.\nFor the amount of food you get for the price, this is a great place to go for a small group splitting the tab equally since it's family-style serving. Order one entree less than the number of people in your group, even if it's a hungry group.\nDefinitely coming back soon!","stars":5}

When my meal came out it was schnitzel on a bed of lettuce and tomato slices. Umm, interesting. I told them that I was really looking forward to having some jaeger sauce and they told me that they would whip something up for me. I was happy about that and thought that our waiter was extremely friendly about it. But...when the sauce came out it was some kind of EXTREMELY salty sauce with a bacon flavor to it, not the creamy mushroom sauce that I was thinking that it was going to be. My husband's friend ordered a burger medium-rare and it came out well done, so he had to send it back. \nI feel bad because I try not to be one of those picky, awful customers that you hear horror stories about, but our meals were not what we had ordered.

I was offered the choice of a shaded or a sunny seat, and parked myself with ample view of Esplanade. I ordered a Perrier while I perused the menu. My server, seeming unenthusiastic and weary at the late lunch hour, detailed nearly half a dozen specials -- how am I supposed to keep track? -- and I chose the blackened snapper tacos. \n\nComplimentary chips and salsa were delivered. The chips were anemic -- thin, pale, and underseasoned. My tacos arrived, two to an order, looking nice. They were served in a build-your-own style, with guacamole, sour cream, pico, and a spicy aioli. The tacos did not include a side dish of any kind. My meal was good, but not great. Acceptable for a very hungry patron, but the snapper was dry and the guac flavorless. \n\nImagine my surprise when the bill arrived, noting my $19 tacos. Yes, the snapper portions were generous, but certainly these tacos were not worth $9.50 apiece. This price could be fair if each taco was carefully curated and the flavor profile nuanced, but I added the toppings myself. And with no sides! \n\nI could chalk this up to a finer dining experience, but throughout my meal, a rotating cast of servers and other Santa Fe employees sat smoking cigarettes and vaping on a bench a stone's throw away, in clear view. All in all, I found Santa Fe to be rather unfortunate. There are too many exceptional restaurants in New Orleans to bother with this one more than once.","stars":3}

I thought the Thai dishes (pad see ewe and Thai fried rice) were great; my wife thought this was her second favorite, and my son thought it was his third. My wife and I agreed that the seafood dish I got was outstanding, And the Japanese dinner was also really good.\n\nThe portion sizes and prices on their hot foods were similar to what we find elsewhere, but if you like brown rice you'll save a dollar or two because they charge less to upgrade. It seems to me that their sushi roll prices are on the low side, so I'll look forward to taking advantage of that in the future.\n\nService is fantastic. They've been busy the three times I've been there, but their waiters work as a good attentive team, and the owner (or one of the owners) goes from table to table to see if you need drink refills, extra plates, or just to generally fill in whatever gaps there might be. And even the sushi chefs, when they're not busy creating their masterpieces, are nice and interactive.

Now, I don't know why he served it to me in the first place if he felt that way, but I digress.  Anyhow, I reordered the blackened shrimp and that was meh as well.

I came across this little hole in the wall last weekend and decided to pop in and give it a try. They were open late, and honestly, quality Italian food is one staple our city could us a little more of, so I thought I needed to give it a shot. I was not disappointed at all! The food was authentic, and there was a clear attention to detail that is often missed when it comes to simple pasta dishes. The pasta to sauce ratio was almost perfect, you could tell they mixed sauce into the pasta before topping it off with a little more sauce. The pasta and the sauce tasted so fresh, and the protein was portioned well so you felt like you were getting a good balance in every bite and the price point was more than reasonable. I gave Mona Lisa 4 stars instead of 5 simply because the service was good, but not as amazing as the food. A few small items were forgotten (refils, extra dressing, straws), but our server was nice, the food was outstanding, and the price was fair. Overall it was a great experience and I will be going back soon when I have a craving for some real italian food.","stars":4}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Mix of good and bad at this hotel. The lobby is beautiful and remodeled.  The decor is a little opulent for my taste but i think that it fits the historic nature of the place.  \n\nThe hotel didnt seem very busy when we were there. I was only in town for one night, so I did not get a great feel for the location but it seemed like the hotel is in a pretty deserted part of downtown Tampa. \n\nSince it didn't seem like much was going on immediately around the hotel, we opted to eat in the lobby for dinner.  We ate at the bar, which had more sandwiches on the menu while the restaurant had more entrees.  I had the blackened grouper sandwich and it was very good.  Note: although the restaurant serves lunch and dinner, they do not serve breakfast, so pack a granola bar or be prepared to walk a few blocks to get breakfast. \n\nThe room was very clean and spacious.  The bed was unbelievably firm and not very comfortable.  I was never provided any bar soap to wash my hands so I had to make due with just the shampoo and conditioner that was provided.  Also the warm water in the shower took forever to warm up. I finally gave up on getting into a hot shower and got into a cold shower, but fortunately after like 5 minutes it warmed up.  I asked for a wakeup call, but the front desk never followed through. Fortunately I always set a backup alarm on my phone.\n\nWould I stay here again, it depends.  I traveled here to go to the federal court right across the street, so you can't beat the convenience of this place.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I'm going to be sad if this is the best Indian food I'll be able to find in New Orleans, because then I won't be able to have Indian food unless I'm out of town... because I will not be going back to Nirvana.\nI entered around 2:10 and after seeing the posted hours that say the buffet ends at 2:30, decided to ask whether the buffet would still be a good option considering the time. The waiter could not understand my question, not matter how much I simplified it. I decided to try my luck anyway and sat for the buffet. \nBefore eating I decided to use the restroom and wasn't too pleased. It just didn't have a clean feel. Next was the buffet line - I spotted dirty dishes and had to go through several plates before finding one that I thought was clean enough to use. I didn't even bother starting with salad. The naan I got ended up being barely edible because it was so burnt and hard. The samosas, though they looked too identical to be homemade, were actually tasty. On my first round I also got rice and peas pullao and chicken tandoori, which were also decent. But, walking back to my table I could feel a stickiness on the floor and detected an odor of urine. \nMy second round I got saag, chicken tikka masala, chicken haryani (not sure if that's the right name, but it was in a light green, minty sauce) and a vegetable pakora that was in a cream sauce. None of these dishes were particularly great. I also got two more pieces of naan that weren't burnt. These naan still weren't great though; they were thick in texture rather than light and fluffy. \nOverall, the food was maybe 2 stars (I spent 4 years in Philadelphia and am used to wayyy better Indian cuisine), but the cleanliness issues make me give it only 1.","stars":1}

I got up early this morning and decided to go check it out.\n\nIf you cannot stand crowds this may not be for you, or get here when they open at 730 AM.  If you expect to get in and out in a hurry, this may not be for you.  If you like to enjoy your breakfast then this is your place to go.\n\nThis place is like a typical diner, but they do tons of omelets, eggs benedicts, and other breakfast items.  I decided to try a frittata and of course coffee.  The coffee was plentiful and fresh, also they ask you before they warm your coffee up.  Also the coffee cups are not the thick ones that make your coffee cold immediately after it is poured into the mug, this always drives me nuts, the mugs are perfect for a good cup of coffee.  It also drives me nuts when you got the coffee just the way you want it they come and mess it up.\n\nThe frittata was plentiful, but not a true frittata, not going to hold them accountable for it because it is difficult to make correctly or well because they are more like a cross between a quiche and a omelet that is served open faced.\n\nAlso they have daily and seasonal specials and I did not see anyone who ordered a bad meal, I think I am going to try out their pancakes next time because they looked perfect.\n\nThese guys are little short staffed at the moment, but you could hardly tell.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Located in The French Quarter.\n\nI came in here with my husband after we finished our Voodoo walking tour. Now I wouldn't normally walk into a place like this, but our tour guide did invite everyone to come in if they wanted to. So we thought it would be interesting to take a look at the different alters made to each of the Voodoo gods after learning about them. \n\nOne thing that really was interesting about learning about Voodoo on our walking tour (Voodoo is the religion and Hoodoo is magic where potions is used) was that the gods are very similar to the Catholic saints. During the time of slavery, especially in NOLA, it was important that slaves converted to Catholicism. Being that those from Africa being brought over here were forced to change their religion (or would suffer very harsh consequences), they were rather sneaky and clever in hiding their dedication to preserve their religion by finding key differences in the Catholic saints. \n\nSo in Voodoo Authentica, in the back room, you can see all of the alters dedicated to the many voodoo gods. And in each little area, you can also read about which saint that god is most similar to. \n\nFrom what we learned on our walking tour, aromatherapy is one way to help with certain ailments\/ anxiety, etc. It was nice to smell the different herbs\/ dried flowers while looking around the back room. \n\nI am rather surprised that this store is friendly for the most part.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This was my first experience at the \"sanctuary.\" My husband grew up in the area and had many memories as a child visiting so when we came to visit family, my mother in law purchased a Groupon for us to experience with our kids. \n\nFrom the moment we walked in, something felt off when we were asked if we would like to purchase a bag of monkey food. It was literally a ziplock bag of Cheetos, animal crackers and other small snacks! I avoid giving my own children this junk let alone an animal that should never encounter or consume such food! I found it ridiculous and so off putting to see people throwing food at the monkeys. The monkeys seemed sad and not very playful or energetic at all. It was bizarre to read about 90% the diets of the monkeys being fruits, seeds, roots etc so I guess the other 10% is naturally Cheetos. \n\nDuhhhhhhhhh, major eye rolling. \n\nThere were other animals in small enclosures as well including alligators, parrots, goats, a rooster and pigs. The animals didn't seem to have nearly enough space to live a happy life. Alligators and tortoises barely had any water!\n\nI seen one adult in the whole place directing children that seemed to be volunteers. Based on demeanor, it seems that they were forced to be there for community service or something. \n\nOverall, my children enjoyed it because kids love animals and we were on vacation so everything was awesome and fun and it was free since the Groupon was a gift so that's how I decided on 2 stars. However, as an adult, I would never pay for this roadside abandoned circus. It overall made me sad and feel that the term sanctuary was misused and misleading for this place to continue to operate.","stars":2}

The waiting area was super kid friendly with toys, a tv that had kid's shows, drinks and all very clean. Everyone was friendly and helpful. When they found that it would be awhile for repairs they had a driver in a courtesy vehicle take us down to the French Quarter and then pick us up at the end of the day.

Definitely a different spin on the bahn mi sandwhich, it just didn't do it for me.  The Hangover pho was good - good spice level, good flavor.  \n\nI got an alcoholic coconut boba tea!!

It was simple but filling. Salsa was very yummy, other dipping sauces in the trio were just ok. \nThe real star of this place is the sub zero tequila on tap. I hate tequila, haven't had it in years but had to try the blue berry ice cold tequila shot here and man was it smooth! \nBathrooms were clean and the place is instantly busy on a Saturday around noon when they open.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"As a Realtor, I have a long history of recommending Housemaster of East Tampa for pre-purchase property inspections to my past customers, I can no longer do so. There have been issues of glaringly obvious missed defects on 3 past inspections for 3 different customers. Lay people wouldn't catch these items and that is why professional inspectors are hired. The first 2 people opted to say nothing to Housemaster as the issues were not deal breakers. However, the last one, after closing on the property, other pros found issues that would have been deal breakers for them- an electrical panel located in a location that is against code, structural termite damage on roof trusses that were within view of the attic access, and much more. After the customers contacted Housemaster to tell them of the discoveries, they received no support and a lot of pushback.

Not going to say that it wasn't worth it but, it felt a little steep. I get the fact that businesses are there to make money but one shouldn't feel like all you're hearing is \"this is great because of bla bla bla\" \"Buy it\", or \"oh check out bla bla bla\" \"buy it\"... Like I said it was more of a vibe than anything else. And for that I wish I could just reduce a half star. BUT.... BIG BIG BUT....\n\n\nAt the end of our little shopping spree, the owner asked us about and told us about real REAL cool stuff. Suggesting to us to go to different places (You'll have to go and experience to get the real 411) She gave us a map she sells, drawing all over it with suggestions of places to go and things to see.\n\nIn the end I believe the only real loss of star was purely for the price.

This is the thing that everyone does when they are at the walk...The aquarium  is filled wit every type of aquatic animal that one can think of ....The Imax theater is also a \"must see\" it is the eye opener of theaters. You will not be disappointed at the several showings they have there...expecially if any one is in 3D.....Finally you must not leave the river walk with out taking a boat ride down the Mississippi.

Inside the waiting room, there was no one at the desk or anywhere to be seen at the business so I was about to leave after 5 minutes when someone finally came and asked if they could help me.\n\nI explained that I already had the tires and just needed them mounted but that was confusing to them and they still tried to sell me tires.  They told me it would be about ~$60 to have it installed and I asked how long it would take.  They said it would be 30 minutes at the most.  I was the only customer at the business and from a look in the garage, there wasn't even another car being worked on.  I figured it would take longer to leave and find another place so I let them do the work.\n\n45 minutes later.....  They started working on my car immediately with all three employees but because I could watch them through the window, they couldn't have moved slower if they tried.  I know how long it takes to mount and balance two tires and I should have been in and out of there once they started the work in 15 minute max.  To the main guy's credit, he did go into the garage and yell at the other guys working on the tires to hurry up.\n\nWhen I got the bill I noticed that he had charged me for new \"tire pressure monitoring gauges\".  This is an older car that does not monitor the tire pressure.  I asked him why he charged for these and said that it was a mistake and that he should have just charged for new stem valves but that they were the same price.

The meatloaf was quoted on the menu as \"Best of the Bay\". To us, it tasted like the best from a week and a half ago. It was dry, tasting of cardboard.  The steak, greasy, full of gristle and of terrible quality. The only positive was our server, Dillon.  He was very courteous and a joy. It's the only reason why the Front Porch is receiving one star.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This is definitely a new star on the scene.  Upon arrival, we promptly had a cocktail at the bar (a generous pour, by the way). The bar and \"foyer like\" reception area is warm and inviting. Natalie Boo's 3D art hangs on the wall and provides a real New Orleans feel to the newly renovated, former shotgun space. After our party of six arrived, we were seated in the main dining room: a small, but uncrowded room with a d\u00e9cor that's conventionally New Orleans. The window allowing guests a glimpse into the kitchen is a nice touch and drives home the recurring theme that the chef\/owner is personally cooking for you. We learned that the chef had cut his teeth at Commander's Palace and Le Foret restaurants after graduating from the prestigious Culinary Institute of America in New York. His sous chef and pastry chef has a similarly impressive resume having worked at Commander's Palace and Couchon after graduating from the same culinary school. \n\nOur meal here was remarkable. Having a party of six, I was able to see and taste a variety of apps, entr\u00e9es, and deserts. Each course was equally exquisite. I started with the scallops, a liberal portion of five (or six?) large diver scallops perfectly seared. Quality ingredients, simply prepared, this dish was as good as any scallop preparation I've had around town. I selected the double-cut pork chop for my entr\u00e9e. This enormous chop was served upon a \"roasted corn coush coush\" with a savory sauce that tasted to me like roasted peppers and demi-glace. Every bite of this dish was perfectly delicious. Other dishes I had bites of: mushroom risotto (reminded me of the smoked mushroom app at Emerils - it was awesome), muscles (the broth was so good I had to mop of the remains with some of the in-house baked bread), and the duck breast (another great one - seriously, a sous vide, caramelized fennel bulb as the accompaniment; exceptional creativity, technique, and taste). I want to keep going back until I try everything on the menu.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, we then received the desert menu. All items are made in house by Chef Joanna Palmer. I would pit her sweet delights against the confections of Sucre anytime. Basil Coconut Sorbet = awesome. Rich flavor. The deep fried cupcakes were the hit of the table. Served with butterscotch, chocolate and vanilla sauces, each bite into the small cupcakes explodes in your mouth as the warm cream cheese frosting is released. Even though titled \"deep fried\", this dessert is not very heavy. Also unique were the large selection of teas and the French press coffee, our guests ordered some of both. The order was definitely worth it. I needed some coffee after all the cocktails and wine.\n\nBottom line.  I was served food that had all of the characteristics of exceptional upscale cuisine: great technique, quality ingredients, and subtle creativity. It did not have the negative characteristics of normal \"haute\" cuisine: small portions and high prices. The average entr\u00e9e price is only $22.00! We passed a real good time. The servers and hostess were extremely friendly and knowledgeable.","stars":5}

WTF??!!!! First of all , management should have had the common decency to come speak to us personally (or at least announce it over the intercom) but to make people stand there for over an hour and not do your best to unload the truck right away is completely ridiculous!

While I have now been to the ER twice, I can't help but to marvel about how excellent their inpatient care is. \n\nThis is Saint Petersburg. Yes, there will most likely be a wait. Probably a long wait. Go to any other the other half dozen hospitals in the area and the wait will be similar. They'll probably even close the ER down to ambulances to work through the backlog (that's a great thing if you're in the waiting room).\n\nThe ER staff is wonderful. The nurses up on the unit are amazing. Everyone is so friendly and its like they jump to cater to your every need. I'm not quite sure how they do it, or even where they get the energy.\n\nBack to that wait... things move much quicker once you're out of the waiting room. That will be the pressure point of your visit. Just get through that and you will quickly discover that it is absolutely worth it. They will take whatever time is needed for you to get on the path of getting yourself better. You can rest assured knowing that you are in good hands.\n\nSimply put, I cannot say enough great things about Saint Anthony's. I rarely give 5-stars, but this hospital is worthy of each and every one of them.","stars":5}

I had the file on a thumb drive, and took it to the FedEx center about 8pm on a Sunday evening.\n\nThe guy behind the counter, copied the info off my drive, and checked through all of the production requirements, and then told me that the job would be completed by Noon on Monday. Sometime after Midnight I received a text message saying that my printing job was finished, and ready for pickup, and then this morning about 8:30 I got a phone call from the store saying that I could pick the job up at my convenience.\n\nI now know that I can email the file to the store and they'll be able to produce everything ahead of time.

They are tucked into the side alcove of the shopping center, and there was plenty of parking.\n\nThe guy refilling the containers of food was helpful and friendly.\n\nI went for one of their signature bowls - #4 Tuna, Salmon, Shrimp Bowl ($12.95). The bowls come with Cucumber, Carrot, Edamame, Pineapple, Masago Egg, Avocado, Seaweed Salad, and Sesame Seeds. This bowl comes with Eel Sauce and Yummy Sauce. I ordered it the way it was listed, minus the Pineapple and with Brown Rice.\n\nThere was a very generous portion of everything. I was especially surprised by the size and number of the Shrimp. All of the ingredients were fresh, and the Seaweed Salad had a lot of flavor. \n\nThe only downfall was the packaging for takeout. I'm not sure how it is served if you dine in, but the three-compartment takeout container seemed to have the Salmon and Tuna in one small container with the sauces over them. That means that the rice, Shrimp, and all of the vegetables were a little lacking in flavor, even after dumping them out when we got home.\n\nMy husband ordered the 3 Protein Bowl ($12.95). He ordered the Tofu and the Hibachi Chicken, and Hibachi Shrimp. He added a random selection of veggies and the Chili Sauce (spicy), and the Yummy Sauce and White Rice.\n\nAgain, good size portions, everything was very fresh. The only downfall was that the Hibachi Chicken and Shrimp were a bit overcooked and dry. (we would have given them a fourth star of not for this).\n\nWe also ordered 4 pieces of Mochi Ice Cream ($4.95). We tried the Green Tea and Mango, and both were flavorful and refreshing.\n\nOverall a very good experience, a few minor things- but we'll probably pop back in again in the future.","stars":3}

The shrimp rolls were normal shrimp rolls except that the shrimp still had the hard shells on the tails!

Finally i went to the drs office and we faxed the paperwork together, then waited another week to be told a billing code was wrong but do you think any one from ccs could pick up a phone and let me or my dr know what was going on? no therefore i am paying cash for my cgm and supplies at my local pharmacy which is far better than the stress of dealing with a company that could not care less about customers.  In closing Miss customer service person before you paste a canned response here asking me to contact customer service by email, dont waste your 2 seconds attempting to show you care, I will not put any more effort in with ccs since you guys clearly put no effort in with your cusstomers,  The only thing I will do now is make it my mission that your contract with medicare is cancelled and that you are pulled from a supplier of Abbot products.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"It's hard to mess up eggs, it really it is.  But Brunchies managed to do it. \n\nI met one of my girlfriends here for brunch on a Saturday, it was her choice of two places that were close to her house, the one she liked best.  I have passed it several times while driving around in her neck of the woods and it was always busy so I had high hopes.  We were sat quickly, especially for how busy they were; however, the food took a long time to arrive. \n\nI ordered my standard breakfast that I order every time I try a new breakfast place because that's what I base the quality of the restaurant on the first time.  My standard order is eggs over easy (or medium pending the bread choices), bacon or ham (depending if the bacon is precooked or cooked to order) hash browns and typically rye toast.  What I received were 3 fried eggs, really?  And our server served them to me.  I knew the minute she put the plate down the eggs weren't over easy.  I didn't say anything then, I figured I would give it a shot first knowing she would be back to table shortly because my friend asked for a condiment. Yep, they were fried eggs, yep my hash browns were not cooked well, and yep, toast tasted stale.  When our server cam back to the table I pointed out the eggs and she quickly offered to have them recooked but at this point I really didn't want to wait.  \n\nThe place is open and spacious and I gather that they have more tables than the kitchen handle on a Saturday or Sunday morning, hence the long wait.  I never saw a manager walking around, one didn't come to our table to apologize or offer to reduce our bill.  I read one of the other reviews where someone stated the place was eclectic diner-style and IF that is what she deems eclectic I feel she should maybe consult the dictionary for the definition.  Again, it's a wide open space, it has ordinary, standard booths and tables.  The walls are all but bare except for the all the canvas paintings which range in style.  They are very carefully evenly spaced apart and add no flair.\n\nI went to restroom and THE one thing I hate about bathrooms (well besides them not being clean) is sticky floors, ew gross.  It always makes feel, well you know, like someone urinated on the floor.  Which what it really means is that the mop has not been cleaned (yes mops need to be cleaned) in a long time.  No thank you.  I hate hearing my feet peel from the floor as I walk.\n\nBecause of the location of Brunchies (not near me) and my first impression, it is safe to say, I won't be back.","stars":2}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This is a Bay Breeze Car Wash but from the street, you're looking for the huge \"$3 3 Minute Car Wash\" sign; the \"Bay Breeze\" sign is barely noticeable.\n\nSo, what is it?  Your typical automated car wash where you pay, run your car through a bunch of big brushes and things that are sure to cover your car in swirl marks, blow dry, then you have the option to use a free vacuum afterward to suck up your kid's animal crackers out of the back seat.\n\nSo.... this is not the place to go if you actually care about your car's finish.  Most people don't, and if that's you, then it's a great value because the wash options start at only $3.  You can pay up to $15 if you add all the fancy things like tire shine, some magical wax product, water beading agent, etc.\n\nThey will accommodate pickup trucks if the tires are not too wide or the vehicle too high; you just have to have the bed empty and 'clean'; i.e. not full of mud.  That's the only reason I use it; it's easy to take my truck through if it's covered in dirt (on the exterior panels).  Like I said in my earlier paragraph; you do not want to take a vehicle here if you care about your paint, because automated car washes WILL cover your car in swirl marks, which will be very obvious on dark vehicles when in the bright Florida sun.  It will take you hours of polishing to get those to disappear, so I would never take a car that I actually care about through an automated washer.\n\nPaying is quick and easy; it's all automated.  Swipe your credit card, dial up the option you want, you get a green light and pull forward into the tire grabber, put your car in neutral and enjoy the show.  If you have a manual antenna, better have put it down by now or you won't have it on the exit end of the building.\n\nAt the end, you can leave, or pull around for the free vacuum access.","stars":3}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"My husband and I visited Kelp Sushi Joint last night for dinner. The interior had that clean, modern\/industrial feel to it. There are a few tables inside, but the dining area is small, so I think this is more of a sushi to go concept. \n\nWe ordered four rolls (Florida roll, Rose Cave, Sailing Stone, & Scorched Earth). One thing we found was that the menu was heavily influenced on three items: cream cheese, salmon, and cooked items. With a name like Kelp, which sounds natural\/pure, it was alarming the number of cooked rolls, rolls with cream cheese, and also with something fried in it. \n\nOut of the 24 rolls that Kelp offers, only 2 of them offer a truly raw experience, and another three are raw with cream cheese. The rest have the fake krab mixture, cooked meat, or are tempura fried. They do have sashimi and tataki appetizers that are raw.  \n\nThe Florida roll ($8.25) was good, but next time we will request no cream cheese in it.\n\nThe Rose cave roll ($13.75) was our favorite out of the four we tasted. It did have tempura shrimp in it, but the tuna was sliced well and tasted VERY fresh. There was a little too much spicy mayo on top for our liking, but that is personal preference. \n\nThe Sailing Stone ($9.25) was okay, but it was our fault we ordered it; it was tempura fried and we totally missed that part where it did say it was tempura fried. If you like tempura fried rolls, you'll probably like this one because the batter was thin and not overwhelming, like most sushi restaurants.\n\nThe Scorched earth roll ($14.95) was interesting, but  the roll itself was basically a California roll with chopped tuna and salmon pieces on top and blow torched. The concept was cool, but we prefer raw rolls. The description was a little misleading, as it does not describe the rolls construction, so we figured the salmon and tun would be inside of it. Lesson learned to ask questions. \n\nThis is also the only sushi restaurant in the area that charges $10.45 for a spicy tuna roll! That is a very steep price. Most of the competitors charge in the ballpark of $5-7 for a spicy tuna roll. Their red forest roll, which has kimchi, roasted peppers, and spinach is $8.45, which again, I find very expensive for a roll consisting of vegetables. \n\nI do appreciate that Kelp is eco friendly in that they are only using sustainable fish and try to buy local as much as possible. I wish they offered more raw rolls (spicy tuna roll with tuna on top, or rolls with raw ingredients & vegetables with no fake crab or cream cheese). But if you are new to sushi and prefer cooked ingredients, this place is for you! \n\nKelp just opened, so they are working out the kinks. With that being said, I'll stop back in and give an updated review in a few weeks.","stars":3}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Very unhappy with the policies (so-called) and the delivery from the manager (Ashley) and server Brittany. We arrived at the restaurant for a baby shower where the mother-to-be had reserved space. Their policy is to charge a 22% gratuity no matter how bad their service is (it was mediocre at best, one server for 24 people) and they won't split bills. Could you imagine a party where people are there to shower someone with gifts and they end up having to foot the bill for everyone? Well, long story short the waitress was asked to bring everyone back menus so that we could know how much we needed to send the mother-to-be via cash app or Zelle. First the waitress Brittney was very confrontational.  Asking I hope you don't have an attitude with me. It's not my fault. I immediately left the area to find a manager. Ashley states that that has always been the policy. I advised that this was not true.  We used this venue for a birthday party for my sister over 30 people and for the breast cancer walk over 30 people as well and everyone had their check. Brittney approached while speaking with Ashley and I could not get a word out. These two were attacking me as if we weren't the customer. Stating they CANT (You absolutely can you are choosing not to) split the bill and the gratuity is mandatory. I see Ashley slip her arm under Brittany's arm to get her to stop talking. Brittany being upset states I'm going to just walk away. I was in total awe. These are the most unprofessional group of people I have ever met. She also stated well your reservation was just for 24 and you have 30. In what world does a restaurant complain about having too many people to charge for a plate and 22% gratuity? The issue is how do you know we are getting charged correctly? Brittany went and printed out 5 copies of the receipt and here we all are passing receipts around using highlighters and pens to try to make heads or tails on receipts that had quantities unknown. It was a nightmare. People think twice about going to Noble Crust on Dale Mabry for large parties. Ashley and Brittney are not suited for hospitality.\nWe were given a card for the Marketing and Events Coordinator.  Bradley Elia.","stars":1}

The food is pretty good, nothing super amazing but nice to have if you want to hunker down for the evening with the beer - the beer is the star of the show here. \n\nWe like to sit at the bar - it feels more personal even for this introvert since we usually come in just the two of us. But there are larger community type tables and comfy places to sit all throughout the interior. Or visit the upstairs bar - definitely the introvert bar - it's also quieter upstairs. The downstairs is usually pretty noisy. Or you can even sit outside and watch the activity on 60. IKEA is right across the street.\n\nOther than the crowds and noise, the only nitpick I have for Coppertail is that there's a weird funky smell in there most of the time - it's not beer cooking, that is always a welcome aroma. It smells more like, and I hate to say this, more like a locker room. It's not overwhelming, and it's not a deal breaker.

The injera was less sour than others that I've tried; I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it was definitely easier on the American palate.

We got seated quickly and no wait which was nice. Once we sat down, we were given a menu book..again, times sure have changed haha! I was like wow this is neat...so we found the basic pedicure and requested that for both of us. We also stated we wanted french with a glittery white polish we had choosen. The lady asked if we wanted the deluxe and we said well basic...and in the menu I saw deluxe was same price so I said oh it's same price, ok sure. The ladies began on both our feet and my friend and I went to chatting away, having great time spending together. They were close to completion and painted our toes and then walked away. We sat there for about 15 minutes and waited ...wasn't really sure if they were done and we were waiting for them to dry or what was going on? No biggie we had been chatting and maybe they didn't wanna interrupt. They eventually came back, put on our shoes and showed us to the front. I was quite confused because I got french and it was clear polish with the tips...I thought french was pink? I went to pay and it was $37! I was blown away...how'd it go from $26 to $37? He told me deluxe was $32 plus $5 for french...I said huh? How's this french it's clear with glitter white top we picked but the pink is missing? He said any tips is french....I also had mis read menu of deluxe  being $32...issue is the layout shows basic for $26, deluxe manicure for $26 then deluxe pedicure for $32...just little confusing when they are right there and you're reading it. I paid and was just like ok.. maybe I'm mistaken on french part, it has been a while....then my friend paid and hers was $32...mind you we both got same thing and I'm clueless as to why hers was $32 and mine was $37...but in fear of them charging her more, I kept my mouth shut. We went to lunch not super impressed with our feet. When I got home later on and closely examined my feet, that's when the real disappointment hit! I had still rugged and torn skin, feet and it's like the pumice stone did nothing! What about the tool that used to scrape the dead skin off your feet, is that no longer used? Anyway my feet look about same as before my $37 expenditure! I will def not be back and do not recommend them unless you just wanna throw money away.","stars":1}

This is an optimal place to enjoy the great outdoors, bring a blanket, lay around and relax! Sometimes it's a bum hang out spot, especially up by the library, which is kind of a deterrent, but most of the time it's nice. Also, the parking situation is a bit scary here, as all the available spots quickly get taken and the only other option is to park far away in the lots and walk. This is also a popular venue for some local concerts, including the popular Jazz fest in october as well as the hispanic heritage concert.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Came here on Friday 8\/31\/18 around 3:30 PM. This is actually my second time here but decided I really need to write a review about this place. I try to get a deep tissue massage at least once a month because I have bulging discs so shoulders and back are always tight. I haven't been having very consistent massage therapists so I decided to come here this particular evening to have someone get straight to the point. I walked in and Leo greeted me. I told him I wanted a 30 min chair massage to focus on my shoulders. He got started right away. He really got in there deep and hit all trigger points so how could I say no when he asked me if I wanted to go for 15 more mins, which then turned into 10 more mins. I ended up getting 55 min massage for $55. It's actually quite comparable to some Massage spas and to be honest I felt great. It's probably one of the best massages I've had if you want someone to really focus on where you're hurting and not just someone gently rubbing on you. The place is very clean and they are professional. When I cashed out it said tips greatly appreciated - I sure hope customers treat them as in any service industry and give a proper tip cuz it was exceptional service. I think I'll just get my regular massages from here on out.","stars":5}

I would definitely recommend setting an appointment even for an oil change, but everyone's very friendly and helpful.

I ordered shrimp and grits and the grits did not have any taste to it even after adding the little container of sauce to it. The jumbaliyah was awesome but it was a small to-go bowl which I used the sauce from that to flavor my grits.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I do not recommend this company for fence material or installation. The owner I am dealing with (Pete) is unprofessional and rude.  He interrupts you when you speak and is not helpful with listening to customer requests.  I purchased a fence for an investment property I own, the fence was installed in January 2020. I am having issues with the fence and Allied sent Tom to verify the issues on 6\/26\/20. Tom apologizes for the sloppy installation and assured us it should get fixed the week of 6\/29\/20. Allied did not show up to fix the fence so I called Tom and he said our work order is in the waiting list and should be fixed soon.  It is now 7\/20\/20 and our fence is still not fixed. So I called Pete the owner\/manager expecting to get some excellent customer service, unfortunately he is not friendly. He argues with me and tells me my problems with the fence are not covered under warranty but he'll someone out there in a few days to inspect the problems.  I am frustrated at this point because Pete tells me they should have never sent Tom out there to inspect the job. I asked Pete why can't someone fix my fence this week because there is already a work order in the system? Pete said he needs to send someone out to look first and states the cracked 4x4 post is not covered under the warranty because it gets hot in Tampa and the missing 4x4 is normal because they don't install 4x4 posts for the fence near the house.  Weird because there is a 4x4 post Allied installed on the other side within a foot of my house. Either way this man is arguing with me and he hasn't even seen the fence that needs repair\/replacement.  I am going to file a consumer complaint to try and get this warranty and fence problem resolved.  Very sad that one of the owners\/managers does not have the customer service skills or compassion to listen to their customers and verify first before arguing. Also he tells me the reason they haven't sent someone out since 6\/26 is because of the pandemic.  This is exterior work and there is already a work order in the system that the owner Pete is completely ignoring and wanting to start the process all over again. At this point it is probably easier to fix the fence myself but definite poor rating for Allied Fence as I paid them thousands of dollars expecting a quality install and I did not get that.  Also thought I had a two year warranty but apparently it doesn't cover simple things like a cracked 4x4 post and a double gate that does not open because it drags and gets stuck scraping on the concrete amongst other issues.","stars":1}

As you enter in the door and proceed to pick up a tray and plate to fill along the massive salad buffet the selection can feel a little overwhelming. I slowly and carefully added items to my plate- piling on my salad toppings. There were a few items that discouraged me from adding them to my plate- the shredded cheese was lumped and stuck to the serving spoon and tongs- which screamed it wasn't kept at the proper temp. I approached the empty cashier station and waited for someone to notice we were ready to pay- just a few minutes. After I paid and picked a table I went back for soup and drink fill. I had picked up a couple bowls that were dirty and set them aside- ew. But that does happen on buffet lines. Hibiscus tea was on the drink bar- YES! And I loaded a bowl of New England clam chowder as my soup choice. Salad was good, the beets I ended up shoving to the side- they didn't taste right. The soup was delicious- mom went up for the cauliflower-cheddar soup and had 2 bowls- WIN! I managed to find the baked potatoes when I was at the bakery station- these things don't seem to go together.... especially since all the toppings were on the other side next to the soup station. Mom never even saw the potatoes! The bakery station had plenty of goodies, but I really wanted a dinner roll-which they didn't have, so I opted for the cornbread which was dry. Again- grabbing a plate I had to cycle through a couple to find one I deemed clean. This wasn't a bad experience- just an ok one- hence the 3 stars.","stars":3}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I must begin this review with a disclaimer. And that disclaimer is that I made this visit to Evos three days after Hurricane Irma came through Tampa. This could explain some of what I experienced on this visit, or it may not. The day I visited the parking lot was completely full with very few places to park.  It was quite crowded even at a later lunch hour of 1:30. After waiting in line for some time I place my order. Because it was my anniversary and I had signed up for Evo's loyalty Club, I had received a buy one meal get one meal offer that I wanted to use. When I showed the offer to the person at the order desk they could not get the offer code to work. But he did honor it anyway. I was surprised that our order of a veggie burger, fries and drink and my companion's chicken strips, fries and drink still came to over $11. A I actually thought that they had forgotten to give me the BOGO. But that was not the case.  Had we not had that BOGO, this very simple meal would have cost me easily over $20. I was givien my cup and a number for my table and I went to get my drink. Alas, there's no ice in the ice machine. This is a biggie for me. A few other people said, \"Oh they're out of ice, well that's okay I'll just drink it without ice.\"  I'm not one of those people that can do that. I went  back  to the front counter and told them they were out of ice . I waited waited some more and then finally when the ice was not forthcoming,  I went out to my car and got my insulated cup that had e a little bit of ice  on the bottom and used that. When the food arrived it was nothing spectacular. I had ordered the champion burger with a veggie patty. It wasn''t very good. And it wasn't very hot. In fact, my dining companion remarked that,  \"Now I remember what air baked means,  it means cold.\"  She had ordered the chicken strips with fries and drink.  I have to admit just looking at the chicken strips,  they didn't look very appetizing. And according to her,  they weren't. I love the fact that Evo's attempts to make fast food healthy. But I have to tell you that Burger King has a better veggie burger. And better fries too, although not air baked. I wish that it had been better because they did offer me a BOGO. But I could have eaten somewhere else that would have been better and cheaper and so this was truly disappointment.","stars":2}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This is an odd place.  I arrived for lunch about 2 pm on a Thursday afternoon.  More than half the tables were empty, yet there was a 25 minute wait to be seated.  My waitress was attentive, so I don't have the complaints about service that some of the other reviewers had.  My take is that they have a lot of tables, but each server can only handle so many tables and they just don't have enough servers to meet demand.   There was a sign on the door that they were hiring servers and about every other position as well.\n \nI chose to order just from the hibachi part of the menu, and specifically had:  hot and sour soup, gyoza, steak and shrimp for the first round and then chicken and shrimp for the second round.  The hot and sour soup was ok, but wasn't really spicy and didn't resemble hot and sour soup Chinese style.  The Goyza were actually very good, but each order consists of only 2 dumplings (in retrospect if I could have had a dozen or two as the whole meal that would have been great).  The steak and shrimp and chicken and shrimp were small portions, and in both case included only a few small shrimp.\n \nSo all in all it was a worthwhile experience, but since I am not a sushi fan I probably won't be going back.  Price for lunch (drink not included) was a tinch under $10 and I left a $2 tip.  The menu isn't listed on here, but if you scroll through the pictures you will see that there are some that other folks took of the menu.","stars":3}

Wow! They had me at pork belly. This was simply one of the most delicious meals I've ever eaten...ever! The grits were creamy and cheesy, the roasted potatoes tender, and the tomatoes juicy, bursting with flavor, and I don't even like tomatoes. The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth tender, egg flavorful and arugula was arugula. Probably the healthiest part of the meal.\n\nWhat worked?\nEvery ingredient was well seasoned. It literally blew me away. \n\nWhat didn't?\nThe price. For all it's deliciousness, at $9.50, the bowl was wayyyy overpriced. It was grits for crying out loud. The pork belly was good, but it was only about 1.5 inches. Two measly tomatoes, about three small potatoes, some sprinkled leaves, an egg and maybe three serving spoons of grits. Not a good value by a long shot.\n\nTo put this in perspective, for $2.99, I can get a half container of grits, about 6 pieces of bacon, and eggs from Triangle Deli.","stars":4}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"First of all, permethrin, their \"botanically-based compound\" is an organophosphate made out of the chrysanthemum plant, and it is NOT NONTOXIC in any way, shape or form, and it is VERY harmful to the environment, even with \"spot treating\", which is not only a silly concept, but a useless tactic! I guess if i didn't know better I would maybe consider \"spot treating\" a less invasive (more eco friendly) approach. Nothing could be further from the truth. Insects are incredibly numerous and have very short life cycles, meaning they become resistant to chemicals really fast. Do you think \"spot treating\" is going to eradicate them? No way. That isn't how insects work! All it does is make them resistant to the pesticides you are spot treating them with because some survive the chemicals and those survivors are now your new superbugs, completely resistant to the chemicals you are employing. \n\nThis really tells you what they are about: \nThe company's phone number has two options. Option 2 for current customers (you have to leave a message and wait for a call back) and option 1 for new customers (there is no way these reps can take complaints--surprise, surprise lol). \n\nThe rep who came to my door was a young guy looking for a sign up commission, nothing more. Who else could you ever get to go door to door soliciting for anything?!\n\nHe kind of smirked and sniffed a laugh, then turned on his scooter and left my house. Very fitting for exactly what this company is all about. I'm so over it. Companies who just want our money and will put us through misery, destroying the quality of life for us and all other living organisms on our planet. Where do you think those chemicals go when you spray them??? Down the street, down the inlets and into our waterways, throwing the whole ecosystem out of balance and creating pathogenic organisms. Not my idea of a fun time!\n\nJust posting the truth. Don't like it? Don't come to my door with a fake, sarcastic attitude and soliciting in a non-soliciting neighborhood or you are going to get a review that exposes you and your irresponsible company.\n\nFor those wanting a more eco friendly approach, please get a compost bin going. The bugs will love it. They will not be in your house or on you, they will be in the bin, creating really good, nutritious, free soil for your garden. Stop tearing down the wasp nests outside your house. They eat other insects. They balance the ecosystem around your house. Put wind chimes out in your yard. They will nest inside the wind chimes and will leave you alone. Quit knocking down spider webs. They eat other insects too! You need them! Quit killing roaches and beetles outside. They are diggers. They make space for the roots of your plants to grow and with those plants comes a more balanced ecosystem with all of the life needed to keep pests under control. Nature does it for you, all for free! And you never have to deal with these swindlers and planet killers ever again. \n\nLet's show this company we can be stewards of the planet. Remember, you can make a difference in your quality of life, and it starts with being aware of chemicals like roundup and permethrin and the money grubbing intentions of the companies that manufacture and distribute them so readily.\n\nI am dismayed to see this company has the word \"environmental\" in their name. The service they are pedaling is horrible for the environment. If the EPA won't stand up to them, we sure can!\n\nAlso, if you can attract dragonflies or pollinators with pollinator-friendly plants, dump standing water, and get rid of bromeliads, it will help keep the mosquito population down. I don't have them much at my house. I have tons of dragonflies sometimes at dusk after a heavy rain, just chowin' down on those pesky mosquitos so I can enjoy my time outdoors. That can only happen if you don't kill the bugs that help and protect you. Bees. We need 'em, they help our plants produce food. We all need to eat. Moths are pollinators too. All are needed so nothing becomes pathogenic--just like our digestive system. \n\nPlease do your part to protect our planet for all of us and for future generations. Not only is the chemical way ineffective and creates an unbalanced ecosystem, but it also costs money! \n\nI believe in using chemicals when necessary, but that means not using them for every little thing or even not using them regularly. Balance is the key, and if we are constantly using these chemicals they will be ineffective when we truly need them. \n\nThat is what is happening right now, and we are the only ones who can stop it. I'm sorry for being long-winded, but the future of the planet is such an important topic, and the health of our environment affects us all.","stars":1}

The breadsticks, both sausage and chicken & gnocchi soups, and chicken meatballs appetizer were extremely salty. \n\nSome cons about the food we ordered: the chicken meatballs appetizer is spicy, the mozzarella chicken is REALLY cheesy (too much), the tortellini are good but the sauce would taste better without the meat in it, the 5 cheese pasta is (again) TOO cheesy, and the tri-colored pasta dish is very plain. The dolcini dessert isn't bad, but out of the amaretto tiramisu, limoncello, and chocolate mousse, the limoncello was the best and the other 2 were mediocre at best (the chocolate one surprisingly wasn't very good). \n\nThis location has great service though, but I feel bad for these poor waiters who have to run around so much because of how busy it gets.

Located in an old Craftsman on 1st Ave. N, it has a nice outdoor area & the inside has several dining areas. I ordered a takeout pizza, thin crust, veggie, etc. The gal who answered the phone was really friendly. When I went to pick up the pie, she remembered that I had said it was my first time ordering from them. \n\nSooo, the pie. Underwhelming, too much red sauce & not enough cheese. I'm from Gulfport & quite frankly Siri's Pizza is the best I've had in this area. Their dough is handmade as are their hamburger buns. Sometimes you have to go elsewhere to appreciate what you have in your own backyard. \n\nJust sayin'","stars":3}

They also have a few tables set up outside for those who prefer outdoor dining at this time. Make sure to have a reservation beforehand because this place is always packed! We love their pizza (huge fans of wood- fires pizza) and can never resist ordering the calamari- perfectly crisp and comes with three unique and delicious sauces ( garlic aioli, spicy mayo, and tomato basil). Our favorite pizza has been the Carne- house- made sausage, smoked bacon, pepperoni, and sweet onions. I'm typically not a fan of meat on my pizza, but this has so much flavor and is not greasy like you would expect. \nThis is a great fixture to the Harahan area.","stars":4}

Sure, they have the lowest price around, but not after you end up paying for all of their 'extras' - they didn't even have the category we reserved available so we ended up paying $30 extra than we originally planned on (they wouldn't give us a free upgrade even though THEY were the ones who screwed up, and since we were 20 minutes away from the airport, we weren't able to go to another company).  \nThe service is HORRIBLE - it took us almost an hour to get our car, and then they charge you a $50 fee for tolls.\nBetter to go with a more established company so that you know the charges upfront and stay away from these slime balls.","stars":1}

I wanted to call to complain but the room phone didn't even have a dial tone. \n\nI heard this hotel was new but it seems as if the staff has been working here for years with the way they were disrespectful to us. \n\nOverall the food was bad and we were disrespected from the beginning.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I generally go to Kingfish for lunch - it is less crowded, it's close, and it is always good.  I like the revamped menu.  The breadth of what is available should be enough to have everyone you're with find something they like - except for a vegetarian.  However, if you were to ask the kitchen I bet they could be accommodating.\n\nMy new favorite is the fish tacos.  Three tacos on white corn tortillas with a flavorful slaw.  The slaw is much improved these days as it was just too spicy before and killed the flavor of the fish.  \n\nAppetizers are good all around - nothing stands out for me.  I do have a friend who thinks the gumbo is divine - me - meh- it is too smoky and I can't taste any of the ingredients - only the smoke.\n\nThe seating is comfortable - the place has a cool tone with the grey, slate and dark wood - but it is not uninviting.\n\nMy one pet peeve is the flies when they have the front doors open.  In the spring and fall when the weather is wonderful they smartly leave the front doors open.  However the flies come in and congregate in the dining room by the windows and buzz around. Nothing is grosser to me than having to fend off flies while eating a meal or chatting over drinks.  They need to get a handle on that- but a set of screen doors or something.\n\nService is very friendly and sitting at the bar is always an option!","stars":4}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Oh geez, I'm not even sure where to begin about my Bern's experience! Let me start by saying that I rarely dress up to go to a fancy restaurant for fine dining. And by rare, I mean never. I've been wanting to try Bern's for many years and FINALLY got around to it tonight. I recently got a promotion at work and decided to make this my excuse to book a reservation. I booked about a month in advance for a Friday night (7:30pm) with a party of six. Five of us had never been before. We were all very happy with the evening!\n\nFOOD FIRST: Steak. This is why we went here of course. We ordered the 17oz Chateaubriand for two cooked medium rare. AMAZING. Really good quality. My favorite part was actually the crispy seared crust that surrounded the juicy steak. It was cooked to perfection and flavored impeccably (I'm a salt lover and this needed none). The steak came with french onion soup which was the best I've ever had. Also heavily seasoned and covered in a thick layer of cheese. Sides included a salad, loaded baked potato, onion straws and veggies. I had my salad with the Cleopatra dressing which is actually Caesar. All dressings are house made and served on the side. My dressing was fantastic with an anchovy floating on top (yum yum yum). Sides today were collards and carrots. Both very tasty and the onion straws were amazing. We also ordered the Lobster Roll...NOTE: this is NOT a sandwich, it is sushi and honestly not very good. This was the only disappointment of the night. The escargot was outstanding though and was covered in a rich spinach sauce of some kind. We visited the dessert room afterwards and tried the Macadamia Ice Cream that our friend ordered. SOOOOOOOO tasty!! Must try!!\n\nDRINKS: Wine galore. OMG so much wine. Too much to handle. There is a wine bible with over a hundred pages of bottles and glasses. Overwhelming. I just asked the waiter for a glass of pinot grigio and the one I had was delicious for $6.25 a glass. The wine cellar at Bern's has over 600,000 bottles of wine!!!! Costliest is $30,000 if you're feeling like a baller. In the dessert room, there is a ridiculous list of dessert wines and fine liquors. I had a German brandy (2 oz pour for $7) which was so incredibly smooth and worth the cost. I will return just for this selection.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Here's where Bern's goes above all others. The entire establishment is beautiful. We sat in the Florentine room which was actually very well lit. Other rooms were dark and ambient. We took the tour of the kitchen and wine cellar (ask your waiter when you are in the dining room if you want to visit the dessert room). The kitchen was insane! So large! You get to see all aspects of production and the massive facts behind Bern's daily workings. For example, they can grill 200 steaks at a time, cut off 75% of the steaks that they use, go through 350 lbs of onions PER DAY and use local farms for their fresh ingredients. Fascinating. The wine cellar is chilly and has a lovely musty smell. Rows and rows of wine bottles along with the 'sample collection' that costs up to $300 per sample. Crazy! The dessert room was by far my favorite. We were seated in what felt like an old fashioned train car. There's a wall phone with music selection buttons and volume control. The rooms are very dark and give you a really chill feel of what fine dining felt like back in the day. I'll be back for sure. This was my favorite part!\n\nSTAFF: Freaking phenomenal. SO professional and attentive. You can tell these waiters take their jobs very seriously. They are dressed to the nines and portray manners that have been forgotten at other restaurants. Bar staff and cooks are also very passionate. I imagine they are very proud to work at Bern's and have been around for a long time. Tip them well, they highly deserve it. \n\nGO. Just go. You must experience it at least once. You'll pay tons of money to do so, but it truly is a trip back in time to when dining out was a luxury. Oh, one more thing...don't wear jeans. You won't be seated in the dining room if you do (read this online).","stars":5}

Dairy Queen, the ice cream shop, was out of chocolate ice cream. I was so surprised I responded \"are you joking?\" Unfortunately, it was true. Two big issues I have with this is (1) when your whole business is ice cream, how do you not have one of the two flavors you sell (and use to make blizzards, etc), and (2) if you are out of one of your two main ingredients, you should have huge signs indicating this in various places outside. We only found out after sitting in the long drive through line - and then there was no where to go. Even if we didn't order, we would have to sit there and wait for everyone in front of us to get their orders before we could leave. The lack of a sign was really worse than running out of one of their two main ingredients. \n\nI would have given them 1 star for this issue, but the staff was so nice and served us so quickly (with our non-chocolate items), and the ice cream tasted good (although not as good as chocolate would have been), I felt like they still deserved 3 stars. \n\nI will hesitate to go to this DQ in the future because I don't want to wait in line to only then find out they are out of chocolate ice cream.

The horseradish was amazing on it!\n\nThe Garden State, Notorious P.I.G, and pizza special sandwiches were great too. The tomato soup dip that came with the pizza one was great and had so much more flavor than Campbell's. We also tried the cheese fries--a new addition, according to the server--and they were delicious. The fries were crispy and hot, and the cheese on top was a great combo of nacho cheese and a white cheese.\n\nThe prices were pretty reasonable--most sandwiches were around $6-7. \n\nOverall, this is a great casual place to eat on Central. I will be back!","stars":5}

It was cold and windy and we were HUNGRY!  It was lunch time, so we decided to walk the Quarter in search of food.  There was a huge line at Desire, and we wanted to be inside, out of the wind.  Tony Moran's was open, so we ventured in.\nWhile the three of us agrees this was NOT what we had in mind for our first NOLA meal, we were happy to be out of the cold and wind, and the place looked pretty fantastic.\nService was horrible!  I think the servers went in back to draw straws to see who would have to take our table.  But first, they had to go find a store open to buy straws to draw!  It was well over 30 minutes before anyone greeted us, brought us menus or took drink orders.  I mentioned we were famished, and one of the bread baskets would be GREAT while we pondered lunch selctions.  Pity it took another 20 minutes for the drinks and bread to get to us!  \n\nCompanion 1 ordered the penne crawfish $24.00, companion 2 ordered the gumbo du jour $9.00 and would share our entrees.  I ordered the special - rib roast with potato and veggie, salad and chocolate mousse dessert $44.00.  C2 loved the gumbo (loved it until we had some at any other place through the trip, including the food court at Riverwalk, that is!), C1 thought the penne was great...I felt the cream sauce lacked any real character.  The veggies with my entree were fine.  Potatoes too salty.  The beef was okay...once I cut past the clearly burnt crust and gobs of fat.  I had maybe 4 ounces of edible meat.\n\n$120 for three people for an OK at best meal.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"The Florida Strawberry Festival has now been a friend's tradition for us for the past 10 + years.  Words cannot even describe the excitement I feel during this time of year.  Think about a huge carnival but strawberry themed so you can only imagine the type of strawberry items they have from the normal chocolate covered strawberries and strawberry shortcake to the more unusual items like strawberry relish tacos.  The festival is held in Plant city every year and for an adult admission you are looking around $10 per person not quite sure how much the children's admission tickets were but it was definitely cheaper.  Now they also have a blood donating bus that is parked near the gates and if you donate blood then I believe I saw that this year they were giving you 2 free admissions tickets for your donation.  Either way I think it is worth the price for a fun filled day with the family.  Food wise you will find all the main staple carnival food that you could think of and even more.  They have a livestock exhibit that you are able to walk through where they have rabbits, chickens and cows up close and personal.  They also have indoor areas with different vendors selling random things that you didn't really know that you needed.  Oh and the best part is that you could get a HUGE flat of strawberries for ridiculously cheap I think I paid $13 for a full flat and I know there are also some stands that sell them for cheaper.  The strawberries this year were so sweet and delicious! Overall if you are looking for a fun day with the family and to eat your weight in sugar and fried foods I would definitely recommend stopping at this festival.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"#500! I definitely saved this place for a milestone review.\n\nWelcome to Bern's. This was, and will be (for you) an absolutely amazing dining experience. Come for the steak, stay for the tours, and don't you dare forget about dessert. Once you walk through those doors there isn't a window in sight, another very important hallmark of the Bern's experience. What's going on outside? Who cares, look at that STEAK. \n\nWe arrived at 8:15pm for our 9pm reservation, and were greeted by a very nondescript, white building with valet parking and a parking lot littered with cool cars. Bentley here, Bentley there...no big deal. \n\nBefore you arrive, make sure you dress to impress, with a Florida touch - or you might get stuck in the lounge. Think east coast business - less the tie. You'll feel the right amount of fancy, and fit right in. \n\nWe started with a drink in the lounge, and I suggest you do the same. There are a lot of comfortable seating arrangements to choose from, so find some room and wait until your table is ready. Treat yourself to a mojito - delicious. A fine example of how real cane sugar can make a drink that much better. However...be sure to nurse it. There is wine to be had.\n\nOnce you are seated, take some time to read over the menu. Read the stories, learn about the cuts, admire the \"meat choices\" page...you'll be here for a while, so read slow. Absorb the information. At the same time, your designated wine appointee should take a look at the wine book, which is at least 60 pages deep filled with bottles that date back 20...30...40...50+ years. Then notice the prices. $50 for wine bottled in 1970, 15 years before I was born? Sounds good to me.\n\nWe ordered three bottles of California based wine:\n1970 Inglenook Pinot Noir (Napa)\n1973 Trentadue Zinfandel (Sonoma)\n1975 Parducci Petite Sirah (Mendocino County)\n\nThree bottles, one table, nine glasses, three serving baskets, one decanter (two of the bottles didn't need it). All three delivered on an angle (so the sediment is not disturbed) opened the right way, open flame included. It was a fantastic process to watch. \n\nGot any questions about the wine? Just TRY to stump these guys, I dare you. It takes a lot of time and training to become part of the waitstaff here, and that includes sommelier level wine training. \n\nNow that you are sipping your various wines, order some steak. Skip the apps; the steak comes with everything you need. We each ordered the Delmonico, medium rare. Excellent balance of meat and fat, cooked perfectly. \n\nBefore the steak got there, we were treated to the french onion soup, which was just the right size and absolutely delicious. Enjoy with garlic toast points, without question. \n\nSalads came right after, and for this, I recommend trying multiple dressings. All are house made, and there are a lot to choose from. Citrus Vinaigrette and Italian Viniagrette seemed to be the table favorites, but I definitely preferred the Italian. I wish I could have brought a bottle of that back home with me.\n\nOrder your baked potato with the works and it'll arrive with your steak. Also on the plate are some fried onion strings, which are enjoyed both on their own or as a complement to any bite of steak. \n\nAt this point, it's been hours. You are full. Time for the kitchen tour! Learn about the giant grills, check out even more cuts of meat, and notice that every single staff member (every. single. staff. member.) is friendly and smiling, even when you are 100% most definitely without question completely in their way.\n\nHead to the wine cellar for a tour what is just a fraction of the the complete Bern's Steak House wine collection. This tour was definitely a highlight of the evening. So. Many. Bottles!\n\nDid you forget about dessert? Don't. Head up to the dessert room, which is essentially run like a separate restaurant. Get your private table, crank up the piano music, and get ordering. Enjoy a glass of port and order a few desserts. \n\nWe went with:\nBananas Foster (gigantic)\nBaked Alaska (amazing)\nCinnamon Ice Cream (amazing)\nKey Lime Tart (good but not the best i've had)\nCheesecake  (amazing)\n\nYeah, we did the fat version of dessert. You should too. Order an iced coffee (just slightly sweet, very creamy), finish up, and leave 4 to 5 hours after you arrived full, tired, and quite happy.\n\nYou will enjoy amazing steak, taste amazing wine, see an amazing kitchen setup and wine cellar, and get fat with dessert, all at a very (Manhattan comparative) reasonable price point.\n\nReservations required, and best made five to six weeks (yes, weeks) in advance, especially for Friday\/Saturday night. \n\nTampa. Bern's. Steaks. Yes.","stars":5}

It was all I could do to stop myself from rolling around in the bowl - it was THAT good - really!\n\nThis was a late lunch and they weren't all that busy so we were able to sit and talk for a very long time without worry.  A wonderful experience -  I am still smiling.","stars":5}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"It was my first time exploring the Hyde Park area on foot, and it seemed like On Swann was the move for a bite to eat according to a friend's recommendation and Yelp. Unfortunately they had no reservations left over online, so we dropped in here immediately after parking to see if they had any availability. Luckily, we were able to be seated immediately outside in the shade with a nice breeze. For food, we decided to go tapas style, although the burger and short rib were both REALLY tempting. We got the burrata with heirloom tomatoes, tuna crudo, hot chicken, and the arancini. This was more than enough food for two people and we were blown away by just how good it all was. All of the ingredients were fresh, the flavor profiles were excellent, and the creativity was impressive. My personal favorite was the hot chicken - breaded tenders with hot honey that were just spicy enough to where I had to dip every bite in the cool orange sauce that accompanied it. We have already made up our minds that we will most definitely be back for the burger and short rib - stay tuned!","stars":5}

I understood the mistake, so I drove through the drive through yet again. I ordered my buttered bagel, to which I received a CREAM CHEESE bagel. So, like any normal person I went through again to get my dang bagel. As arriving at the window I told the employee how he had made a minor mistake as to giving me cream cheese instead of butter.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This time I decided to drive over and pick it up. Last time it took over an hour for delivery and pizza was a slight bit better than lukewarm. Personally, I prefer my pizza hot and steaming right out of the oven. I won't fault these folks for the long delivery time as it was a Sunday afternoon during football season.\n\nAnyway, it's still Lent in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, so that still means no meat for us at any time.  What did I order this time, you ask? A white pie? A veggie deluxe?? Plain old cheese??? No, I say!\n\nWe tried a Margherita pie, which was how the real \"first\" pizza was supposedly made in mid 19th century Naples.  Just some garlic, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil on a thin, crisp crust of fresh dough. Well: this one also had pizza sauce on it.\n\nAnyway: there certainly was a decent amount of sliced tomatoes and round, yummy morsels of fresh mozzarella. When I got to the shop, the pizza man was just tearing up basil leaves and sprinkling them onto the hot pie.\n\nHe even looked at me and said \"You couldn't have timed that any better!\" Well: it certainly was hot and it only took me five or so minutes to get back home. So it still WAS hot when I opened the box.\n\nI almost always ask for my crust to be well done. They certainly obliged in that regard! It had a nice bit of char which can be hard to get from a gas oven rather than a coal or wood fired one. No bubbles or blisters either, just flat, crispy goodness. The crust was bordering on dry, which is fine. Toppings certainly helped keep it far enough out of the desert.\n\nAs I stated earlier, they added pizza sauce to the rest of the requisite ingredients. Seemed like a bit much in the sauce department for a Margherita pie, but on the plus side it helped with the garlic and oregano flavor. \n\nFresh mozzarella was good; tomatoes were still juicy and the only criticism is not quite enough basil on the top. The Queen Bee said she'd have it again; I didn't dislike it at all and nearly half the pie is left for a quick lunch. Not bad for less than $15!","stars":4}

I found out after we ordered that you can order the wings naked (not breaded).  Moved into the dining room where Suzanne waited on us and she was fantastic!  All sorts of Pittsburgh Steelers decorations as I assume the owner is from there.  Lots of TVs and they have NFL Ticket too.  I ordered the she crab soup, sans sherry and it was delicious!  A bunch of crab, along with some spices which gave it a tiny kick.  I swear I could have licked the bowl.  Hubby had gumbo, which he added that hell sauce to, and said it was very authentic.  He then got a seafood combo plate with grouper cheeks, scallops and shrimp, which were all fresh and lightly seasoned with garlic, paprika, etc.  I ordered the snow crab and hubby helped me finish as it was a ton of food!

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Donatello Restaurant is a leftover of a bygone age of old-school restaurants. The reason that Donatello restaurant has survived is a mystery to me. I had tried Donatello's about 3 times in the past and was completely disappointed each time. Recently good friends of mine choose Donatello for dinner, what the heck perhaps it had changed. I can see why some people go Donatello's their valet and Host greeting is a nice touch and I'm told they usually have great music. The music was great the night we were there. Now that we hit the high points reality is coming. Donatello's like Bern's is in a warehouse building with few windows and very dated decor. We arrived at the bar and it was thriving with mostly people who knew one another. The first bottles of Champagne I ordered off the wine menu they were out of. The Owner (a charming well-dressed man) said he something special for me to try, the bottle was corked (oxidized wine). We're now 45 minutes and no champagne. The gentlemen brought another bottle of Champagne it too was corked. Finally the 3rd bottle was good. At this point everyone was a bit tense. Oh the 3rd bottle of champagne was warm... About that time our table was ready. We were seated in a large room with awful decor which was dark and dingy. Our waiter was a wonderful older gentlemen, I ordered a bottle of red wine which was wonderful. We ordered 4 appetizers, fried calamari - over cooked and greasy, bruschetta - giant slices of bread and course chopped vegetables - tasted good but awkward to eat, escargot - very tasty, Carpaccio - nothing special. For the entrees 2 of us had a trio of pasta - poorly plated and barley edible, one friend had the catch of the day smelled fishy and was over cooked and my other friend had a veal dish which said was okay. As I remember the desserts were okay. \nI'm not one to complain about the check but over $1000 for mediocre food served in a warehouse seemed way over the top! If you feel the need to be scene then try Donatello's, just don't expect good food.","stars":2}

That, with a couple beers always hits just the right spot for me. \n\nOne last part about this place that makes me love it is that you can buy beer (to take home) from there!

An angry liberal left a note on my vehicle regarding my political views after I went into the YMCA.  I was only gone for a few minutes.  Once I realized there were security cameras I asked Angie if we could figure out who left the notes and if they were a member.  She assured me she would review the footage and try to help and would follow up by calling me - after taking down my number.  Needless to say a phone call was never received.  To me this just sends the message that they do not care about their members' experience at the YMCA.  I would never in my life leave a nasty note for someone I disagreed with.  All I expected was a follow up, possibly a warning given to the person if they were in fact a member.  She was under the impression the person was not a member.  But we wouldn't know that unless video footage could verify that. Needless to say as a Navy veteran I didn't appreciate the note or the lack of follow up or diligence on the part of a member.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This Slice Pizzeria beats actually beats the location on St. Charles (and I love that location. Just sayin')! I've eaten here for lunch three times this week- a record for me. I tend to just eat something on the run for lunch, rarely sitting down to enjoy an actual meal. But now it's a new habit, what with Slice being a couple blocks from where I work (btw, they have free wifi). One thing that is uniquely awesome about them is that they let you order smaller portions, so you can mix and match. Meaning, anything from a variety of slices to half salads and half pasta bowls. Not that you can't gorge on half portions (ahem). \n\nI am currently having a passionate love affair with the mesclun salad that comes with berries, goat cheese and walnuts with balsamic vinaigrette. I need a moment or two to bask in the memories of just a few hours ago...\n\nOk. I'm good. Carry on.\n\nAlthough normally I'm into just about any of their pizzas, today I ordered a calzone. A giant mound of crescent-shaped dough arrived stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella (as it should be. For some reason places put in *just* mozzarella. That would be sad and wrong. Just sayin'). I added in spinach, b\/c I was feeling guilty about ordering such a decadent lunch. True, I only ate about 1\/4 of it in that sitting, and you might like to know that when I grazed on it later, it was almost as good cold!\n\nStaff is *so* friendly here, too. Atmosphere is a bit more open and warm (though part of the charm of the St. Charles location is that it reminds me of a NY pizza shop). \n\nI've only been for lunch, but those daily drink specials make me want to reconsider my stance on no day drinking.","stars":5}

There was not much to choose from on  the menu in the first place, plus it was a bit misleading. Additionally, the food was pricy but, to be fair, it's to be expected in the French Quarter.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I've lived at Post Harbour Place for 5 months and will be moving out early. The location is beautiful but the grounds aren't maintained very well. \n\nBe prepared to live in a dorm.\n\n1. There is dog waste everywhere. I have a small dog, and I understand that everyone is responsible for their own pet, but when I say everywhere I mean everywhere. As one of the only apartment complexes that allows dogs of all types, it seems that there many people choose the property because it is pet friendly. The obvious consequence is that there will be dog waste all over the grounds, but also in the doorways, hallways, sidewalks, and streets. This can range from chihuahua to 130 pound boxer waste. Just prepared to step in it and smell it. \n\n2. The property smells like urine. Because there are so many dogs, the stairways, railings, plants, mulch, parking blocks, and basically anything above ground height has been thoroughly soaked. On a warm day--and there are obviously many--everything smells bad. It's embarrassing to bring people over when you have to walk over dog waste only to be greeted by the smell of dog urine. The maintenance staff pressure washes regularly, but it's just not enough. \n\n3. You will have to navigate vomit. Recently a tenant threw up outside of the elevator and because it was a holiday, the vomit stayed put for a day and a half. I've have personally seen vomit in the hallways more than once.  Think about that. You're going to walk down the stairs at some point and see a big pile of vomit splashed all over the floors and walls. \n\n4. Parking is a total nightmare. There are spots for the residents but you should be prepared to walk up 3 or 4 flights of stairs everyday or pay $50 for a reserved spot. Your guests will have no where to park. There is a pay lot that is $7 a night. \n\n5. Expect at least $50 extra per month to cover trash ($7) common area utilities and water. It's not a big deal, but they only tell you about the trash charge. When I asked about the water, I was told it was included. What was meant was that it was included in your bill, not the rent. \n\n6. The property managers are extremely nice and very helpful, although they basically all say the same things, over and over. \n\n7. Breaking the lease results in a fee equal to two months rent ($3400). The lease is transferable to another property, but you'll be required to sign a 12 month lease at the new location. I've visited four Post properties so far and they're basically all the same.  \n\n8. The walls are pretty thin. You will hear your neighbors TV, stereo, and them walking around. As I'm writing this, my downstairs neighbor is watching some sort of action movie and the floor is shaking. He's been spoken to by the property managers 7 times. Nothing happens. \n\n9. There is a ton of traffic in and out of the garage and on the streets in general. It is not safe for children. People drive very fast, with little regard for pedestrians and there are no stop signs. \n\nThe rent is about $1700 for a two bedroom apartment, on average. Each apartment is different so the individual units will vary. For that, plus parking, plus $50 in fees I expected a nicer place. Instead, this is a nicely located, expensive, dorm.","stars":1}

This sounds like an exaggeration, and I wish it was. But they literally raised prices 4 times in the last year. On the water bottles. And on the water dispenser. And on the deliveries. The last straw was when they raised prices almost 15% during the Coronavirus Pandemic. When I called to ask them about the price increase, I asked why they would raise price on a water cooler rental that's been sitting in my house for 5 years and paid for itself 10 times over. They had no answer for me and said they had increased business costs. But every time I call in to speak with the billing team (which is a joyous, almost monthly tradition) no one answers their phones for 30-40 minutes. I also read they laid off a ton of staff too but yet raised their prices?! Insane greed. Taking a free natural resource like water, and exploiting it to the max. \n\nOn top of all that they miss deliveries, have unprofessional staff, and are just not a company I want to give my money too anymore. I bought a $200 cooler on Amazon (that will pay for itself in a year and a half (compared to their cooler rental prices).

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I live near Robert's so I did a little math to figure out if I need to start paying for home deliveries. I compared a random sample of popular brands and staples from Rouses, Walmart, and Robert's. Unlike other reviewers, I found the in-store prices matched Robert's website and weekly ads. \n\nBuying from Walmart would probably save me about 10-35% on average compared to Roberts. In my case, the costs of driving to Walmart or delivery are about $6 or $8 respectively.\n\nSo for weekly grocery orders over $80, I would greatly benefit from driving to or delivery from Walmart. For weekly orders over $20 there is a good chance I would save some money. If I only plan to buy $20 of groceries in a week, I am better off buying from Robert Fresh Market. \n\nThis does not include Robert's weekly deals. Deals can reduce prices for a few items by about $0.30 to $1 per unit cheaper than the same item at Rouses. For items on sale, it is always better for me to buy from Robert's. \n\nTheir pricing seems (to me) meant to give the impression they're a high end store and maybe discourage lower income customers. With home deliveries getting cheaper and easier, this old school Whole Foods strategy might not last.","stars":3}

My friend and I were intrigued and immediately signed up! I am a vegetarian, so was very hesitant that I wouldn't really be able to eat anything, but the entire staff was accommodating to my restrictions. \n\nWe showed up the following day about fifteen minutes early. When we first checked in, we were handed recipes of the food we would be tasting today! I was handed a vegetarian recipe for jambalaya, vegetarian gumbo, bananas fosters, and praline! WOW! that was enough for me right there. The staff called us into the cooking demonstration room in the order we signed up for the class, which I thought was VERY fair. Unfortunately, me and my friend got seats in the back. But they had TV cameras and mirrors so we could still see what was going on and what was being made. Our teacher, Lynn, was FANTASTIC. She loves to talk and knows so much about the New Orleans culture and tradition. I learned a lot not only about cooking but about history as well. The food was delicious, with large portions.

I think it will be a better experience once business slows though. \n\nAs far as the food, the banh mi thit nuong was just 3 stars. The flavor was a little off and not a whole lot of pork. The red bean boba tea was good albeit very sweet. \n\nThey have a wide variety of options (though not much beef), both on the menu and grab and go. The space is nice. I put this on the same tier as Simply Pho - average Viet food (which is still good) with above average service in a modern atmosphere.","stars":4}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"The food was average here, not bad at all... however when me and my family payed for our 200 dollar bill, all hell broke lose but let me explain how things led to it... My mom ordered a drink off of the happy hour menu, and there was a bug inside so she sent it back,when the next one came it was not to her liking so she did not drink it and ordered a regular drink , so when the bill came my mom asked the waitress (Lucia )why she was being charged for a drink she did not drink, the waiter stated she had to pay because she ordered it, my mom said \"OK\" and we simply paid, the hostess (not sure of his name ) Caucasian older gentlemen comes over to the table (as if he is management ) and asked us what happened, we explained and he proceeded inside the restaurant so we figured he was going to find a solution for the issue, but no he didn't, as we were grabbing our belongings and leaving after paying , the hostess (same guy) walks over and says \" yall are lucky she even waited on yall..yall kind always want something free\" that is far by the most racist and disrespectful statement I have ever heard and then he waits to say all of that while we were leaving, I am offended because I payed a 200 bill and NEVER complained about paying for the drink that wasn't touched, he should have never came over to the table and asked us anything if he was not going to solve the problem, I will be reaching out to cooperate because as a tourist I was not expecting any thing close to this awful terrible customer service, that man should be fired and then after we asked him why he was being so rude we just paid a large bill and then threatens to call the police, not ok!

The ceviche was pretty good, as it was my first time ever eating it. So that makes me wonder if it really was good. Also, I noticed that traditional ceviche is diced up. This restaurant serves the shrimp whole, but it wasn't an issue. Now what you have been waiting for... the tacos. These were the worst tacos ever. I could have made better ones at home. The mushroom tacos were ok, but it was just too much garlic sauce. The carne asade was sooooo bland. I doubt they cooked it without any seasoning. And the carnitas were extremely salty.

The pot pie bites are amazing and a perfect light appetizer and so is the buffalo flatbread but I tend to get that as my meal.  I have also tried the ham and black bean quesadilla which I was a little hesitant on because I only recently started liking black beans and it was so good!

One opened the door on Burgandy (the frame was is complete disrepair and appeared to have been kicked open a few times and screw-gunned back together) and the second key opened our room door. That frame was destroyed as well. There was a visible gap of a half inch, even when the door was shut and locked. The room was clean and the a\/c worked. We did have a digital camera disappear from the room (after turn down service, so it was most likely another guest). There were also several holes poorly repaired on every wall in the place.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This is a truly amazing, small-batch gourmet brownie company operating out of Pinellas County. Barry's Gourmet Brownies started as a family recipe and a home-kitchen hobby for Barry Wax, namesake of the firm. Barry and his friend, Doug Byrd (now CEO), promoted the brownies at various commercial food trade shows to rave reviews from the attendees. Doug bought the rights to manufacture and promote the brownies in a larger commercial kitchen, and the business was off and running.\n\nNow 14 months later, this incredible small business success story produces four different types of brownies inside their commercial bakery located near the Feather Sound area of Clearwater. The four styles of brownies currently being produced are Double Chocolate Chunk, Salted Caramel Chocolate Chunk, Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk and Raspberry Chocolate Chunk. \n\nThe brownies are produced in small batches in commercial mixers, and then injected into small trays which are then weighed, leveled, and topped with more chocolate chips. From there the brownie trays are stacked onto baking racks and wheeled inside large commercial ovens. After baking, the racks are left to cool, and finally the brownies are packaged for distribution. In some cases the entire tray is shrink-wrapped for distribution to bakeries and restaurants. In other cases, the brownies are cut into 2-ounce, 4-ounce, or tiny little bite-sized servings and then individually wrapped for sale.\n\nThe shrink-wrapped brownies are packed up into display boxes for consumer sales, or larger boxes to be sold to grocery and convenience stores. You'll find Barry's Gourmet Brownies available for sale in locations all around the country, or you can visit the company's website and place an order for sampler assortments or custom boxes of your favorite type.\n\nThe finished brownie boxes are stored in large commercial freezers at their second facility near the St. Pete \/ Clearwater airport, and shipped directly around the country. For long-term storage you can keep the brownies in your freezer for about 9 months. If your will-power is weak, then you can store them in the refrigerator for a few weeks, or just leave them out on the counter and wonder where they went.\n\nAccording to the package instructions, Barry's Gourmet Brownies taste best when they are re-heated in the oven or microwave, and then topped with chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream, or whipped cream.\n\nWe all love dessert, and Barry's is a local company, producing a phenomenal gourmet product that I know you'll enjoy!","stars":5}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Well, Yelpers, you came through again! I researched where to eat in this area, and you hit the nail on the head for an excellent Taco Tuesday!\n\nAfter exploring Hyde Park Village for a bit, i headed over to Bartaco. My original plan was to sit on the cute outdoor seating area, but no one was out there and I really didn't want to make one server have to remember someone was outside. So to the bar I went. I had studied how ordering worked and quickly filled out my lunch order special - for $11, I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and three intriguing tacos - the chicken chorizo, portabello mushroom, and cauliflower.  My bartender came over with a tasty pinot noir, and i enjoyed a little people watching and browsing through my phone. Some area businessmen came in as well as some families and groups of friends. It was a quiet Tuesday after Thanksgiving, but I can tell it must get busy in the evenings and on the weekends. \n\nNot too long of a wait and my food arrived. WOW - the soup had generous pieces of chicken and was just the heat needed on a slightly chilly day. On to the tacos! Wow - keep in mind, these are street tacos, they're smaller than the overservings you get at a Tex-Mex place. They also have a lot more crafty flavor tucked into them. The cauliflower was a fun taste with a little kick to it. The portabello was meaty and flavorfull, and the chorizo was a fun texture with some smokiness. I wish I could go back to try the many other types they have, as well as some of the delicious looking appetizers.\n\nMy server helped direct me to different areas, and he was most helpful and friendly. \n\nI really enjoyed my stop in, and i know you will too! Super affordable, crafty, friendly, and just a delight. I hope my path brings me back one day.\n\nBeing it was such a lovely day, I took a walk through the neighborhood and hit Bayshore Blvd for a 25 minute leisurely stroll back to downtown Tampa.","stars":5}

They took longer than she told me it was going to take, then I had to return TWICE. Once for them to fix my ac they forgot to plug back in, and returned again the following day so they can re-angle the backup camera. The way it was positioned was useless. The second time I came back they made me stand outside in the heat for almost an hour while they do it. Didn't even offer me a chair. She kept telling me I don't know how a camera is supposed to look & I need to 'program it myself'. I know it's not supposed to point straight back & I should be able to see the ground. Pathetic ass customer service after I paid $1400 for everything & they didn't deliver a quality product at all. My controls on my steering wheel no longer work, was told I'll have to pay an additional $150 in order for them to get it to work again.

She never apologized for the lengthy wait. We got our food in a timely manner. We told her that we were ready to pay and we gave her the card instantly knowing she'd disappear again. Either the restaurant needs to staff more people or she needs to learn to multitask. I totally get that people don't always come in for their shifts.

Wet warm and fresh upon arrival. The garlic naan was definitely the best part of the entire order, and the entrees left little to be desired. The chicken tikka masala sauce was very dark red and sweet, which was a first for me, I'd never had a sweet tasting sauce. It wasn't horrible by any means, but I had a specific flavor profile I was looking for and this wasn't it. I also had the lamb baldi ghosht, which this was my first time having this fish, so i wasn't sure what to expect. It wasn't bad but didn't really have much flavor to it. Usually with Indian food you get a beautiful, aromatic explosion of flavor, but not in this dish. Overall this was definitely lower on the scale of all my Indian food experiences. I'll likely try another place rather than trying other dishes at this restaurant.","stars":2}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I found this little gem in my phone map. I had to take a hike out that way to get fingerprints done at a facility two blocks down. When I searched my designation location I saw the name of the restaurant on the map so I yelped it first. I decided if I had to drive all the way out there then I wanted to make it worth the trip! I do have three complaints that I will get to. I do want to mention that you REALLY should never judge a book by its cover. Two gentlemen approached the store as customers and neither looked like they would ever order from a vegan restaurant. One of the men had a very tough exterior, like a biker (my in-laws are bikers so love them all). The typical clothing, long beard, and had the most beautiful Shepard service dog. He approached where I was waiting for my food after walking out of the Irish Pub next door. The man who came to the door with my food acknowledged the man waiting by name which tells me he is most likely a regular there. Either they are both vegan or both have found love in this restaurants food. \n\nMy first complaint would be that there were so many items on the menu that weren't available for order. I read reviews for the cubano and really wanted to try it. Unfortunately, it was one of the items unavailable. I guess I can't complain too much with it being the day after Thanksgiving and they were still opened for business. My second complaint which is also an applaud to them is that you cannot enter the store\/restaurant. I applaud them for their due diligence in keeping their employees safe as well as their customers during these scary times. It was also a drag that they have somewhat of a store front of items that are not listed on their site. Looking through the window they have a sizable selection to look through from shelf, refrigerated, and fresh baked items. My suggestion would be to add pictures and prices to their website with the ability to order them online while they are staying safe. \n\nI really couldn't make up my mind, on what was available, to order. It's was a bit of the drive so I splurged in finances and ordered 2 meals and extras to try a few things on the menu. I ordered the Philly sub which was perfection! Even after the 20min drive, quick stop at a store, then home everything was still warm from being freshly cooked. I also ordered the Cali wrap which I wish I would've paid the extra $1 to add vegan provolone cheese. The wrap was huge and stuffed packed! They definitely didn't skimp on the avocado which was pleasantly surprising and rare. So many greens added, which again was a plus! Both meals comes with chips and water. The chips are gluten, GMO, and preservative free. They were fantastic! My last complaint was the bottled water brand being niagara, which is still better than Aquafina. It was still drinkable. I'm not done.... lol I also ordered the sriracha macaroni. I didn't thoroughly read the menu and thought it was going to be a Mac-n-cheese (they should make some) and threw it in the microwave. It's a macaroni salad so I had to re-chill it to consume but it was ok, if I was more of a macaroni salad person. And last but not least...... I ordered 5 of the \"bone-in\" wings in Korean BBQ sauce. If you've never had the pleasure of trying Korean BBQ sauce, this is a MUST!!! I was so curious to see what the \"bone\" was, so to keep you vegans from freaking out like I kinda did, it's like a very thick and wide and possibly sugarcane or something plant related. They were extremely good, it's just with texture it was a little too close to the real thing for me but the flavor will outweigh texture! \n\nEating vegan or even healthy comes at a price. Yes, I paid more than I would normally for a lunch meal but that's what we do. I hope to be able to make another trip in the future and have more menu options available to order. I definitely HAVE to try the Cuban and potato salad as well as a pizza. It is a good thing that this place isn't closer to home cause I would be eating out way too much out of budget! This place is..... VEGAN DONE RIGHT!","stars":5}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Ein Muss wenn man in Tampa ist. Nein, ein Muss wenn man irgendwo in der Umgebung ist.\nDas Columbia sollte weit oben auf der Liste der Restaurants stehen, die man in Florida besuchen m\u00f6chte. Zum einem liegt es an dem sehr sch\u00f6nen Ambiente des Restaurants, man findet sich in einer ganz anderen Welt wieder, als noch vor dem Laden. Es ist das \u00e4lteste von einer Familie gef\u00fchrte Restaurant in den USA und erstreckt sich mittlerweile \u00fcber mehrere Geb\u00e4ude. Der Block vor und hinter dem Columbia geh\u00f6rt auch dazu und dient als reiner Parkplatz. Hier stehen sicher an die 200 Autos rum. Reservieren sollte man hier vorher also unbedingt, sonst warten man schon mal 1-2 Stunden auf einen Tisch. Dann am Service, der entsprechend freundlich & aufmerksam ist. Und zuletzt nat\u00fcrlich an dem Essen.\nDas Essen kann ich leider nicht uneingeschr\u00e4nkt empfehlen. Ich schreibe es mal vorsichtig: Es gibt bessere Cuban Sandwiches in der Umgebung. Es war einfach zu trocken und schmeckte nach gar nichts. Daf\u00fcr war der Columbia's Original 1905 Salad alleine den Besuch schon wert. Er besteht eigentlich aus keinen besonderen Zutaten, ein einfacher Salat eben. Aber einfach ist dann doch oft besser. Frisch am Tisch vor den G\u00e4sten wird der Salat vom Service zubereitet. Eine nette Show und geschmacklich super. Danach sollte man unbedingt Chicken & Yellow Rice Valenciana essen. Die Portion reicht sicher f\u00fcr eine ganze Familie, schmeckt aber so lecker, dass man nicht teilen will.\n\nEmpfehlung: Columbia's Original 1905 Salad, Chicken & Yellow Rice Valenciana","stars":4}

It's okay, but there are better breakfast options out there in my opinion (especially a the nice new one right next door). \n\nThe reason I'm not crazy about this place is because they don't make cafe con leche or cortaditos the traditional way. They make it like coffee and you sweeten it yourself. Technically that's not the way it's done and it takes away from the taste that I can get when I'm in Miami. \n\nI will say that they make excellent pancakes. However, today there was something foreign in one of my pancakes.

Despite growing up in New Jersey, I consider myself a Philadelphian from living there almost 30 years. \n\nI am here helping my sister who just had a kidney transplant. So the thought of finding a comparable cheese steak anywhere outside of the City Of Brotherly Love is usually a disaster. Philly Phlava is an exception to that rule. Is it on par with Steve's Price of Steaks or John's Roast Pork - my hometown favorites? No. But they make a formidable cheese steak. \n\nThe key to any great cheese steak is the roll and this shop gets Amorosa rolls sent from up north. The meat was relatively lean and tasty (they could cut back on the salt - WAY too salty).The portion of meat was ok - not stuffed but not weak. I got a steak because that was what my sister wanted and I figured I would try it(she adds green peppers to hers - a major Philly no-no). I got mine the only way a true Philadelphian would - provolone cheese and fried onions. \n\nI liked the Philly sports apparel on the wall. Even some of the employees come from the area (like the excellent young lady working the counter who is from Maple Shade NJ - right over the bridge).

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I had a pretty awful experience for dinner at Royal House. I want to include all the details, so I apologize for the length of this review. It started off right. Our server, Danny, was personable and had great recommendations for the table. We had entered the place ready to enjoy ourselves, and he was delivering a great experience. Everyone in my party was there for the seafood, and I had called ahead to ensure they would be able to make one of their dishes vegetarian. I am always a little wary of places being understanding about dietary restrictions. My restriction is not a casual preference, but a deep religious belief, and respect of additional questions I have is very important. The host who answered when I called volunteered that one of the dishes I was looking at was fried in the same oil as meat, so Royal House seemed to be one of the establishments that respected restrictions. My experience when I received my food, however, was very different.\n\nThe appetizers we had were all decent. When the entrees came out, the food runner put mine down and mentioned oysters. I asked if there were oysters in the dish, since I had ordered without. He said he didn't know, he just ran the food, and that was the name of the dish. Fair enough. I asked if our server or someone else would be available to confirm. He then got defensive and said he was just someone who brought the food, and how was he supposed to know what was in my dish? If the server had put a note in, I would be fine. I know from experience that notes are often missed in busy kitchens. It is much better for me to confirm then have a surprise reaction to my dish. After a few minutes back and forth asking to speak with someone who would know, he told me that the dish actually didn't have oysters. The oysters would be on top. At this point, I needed to be certain there hadn't been a mixup. This is where things really went downhill with disrespectful service.\n\nDanny had been busy and I couldn't find him, so I asked the hostess if she could confirm with the kitchen. The manager on duty that night came to address me, and immediately approached the conversation as if I were being unreasonable. She told me that she apologized that the food runner called my dish by its name, which included oysters, but the oysters would be on top of my dish so there were no oysters in the dish. I said I understood, but I really wanted her to check with the kitchen and confirm the dish, as made, was 100% vegetarian. Kitchens add animal fats, Worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce, and other ingredients all the time. She told me she didn't need to check with the kitchen because she had worked in the kitchen, and the oysters would have been on top. This was reiterated to my four times. Each time, the manager refused to check with the kitchen. I believe the manager's name was Taia, but she was reluctant to give me her name. She told me she loved her guests, and she didn't know why I was treating her badly. I didn't feel I was treating her badly, but I really couldn't understand why she just couldn't confirm with the kitchen to make me comfortable. I started to get upset. She wouldn't look at me or address me with respect. She kept looking at one of the members of my party, who was also black, as if asking him to reason with me. I suddenly felt like I was being treated differently because of my Indian descent. When Danny returned to the table, he found me tearful. \n\nI didn't eat my meal. The manager later came over to give us the check and aggressively showed the members of the party the note about not having oysters in the dish. She did take that off of the bill, along with an order of oysters that had not arrived before our entrees. There was no other apology, because she felt she was fully correct in not double checking that my meal was safe for me to eat. \n\nAt the end of the meal, she came back to our table, and asked if there was anything else she could do. I told her I would have been fine had she just checked with the kitchen, and tried to explain how serious my vegetarianism was. At this point she interrupted me and again told me I had been treating her very badly on Mother's Day. She actually suddenly decided to tell me she had checked with the kitchen, and told me she had checked with the kitchen four times. I had misunderstood her. This is another moment where I felt I was being treated differently by Taia due to my race. Perhaps she assumed English wasn't my first language. I had been stubborn about needing this confirmation earlier to feel safe, and she had explicitly told me that she would not do it. I know I did not misunderstand her. She then accused me of not saying thank you like other members in our party. I certainly had nothing I felt thankful about when it came to her service. Our waiter Danny had received plenty of thanks. I was extremely upset about the way I was treated here. The food was fine, but this sort of disrespect was unacceptable.","stars":1}

In fact it has a lot of land which allow for extensive nature trails and a very large sports complex for volleyball and tennis. The club has a golf area with flags for the holes but no greens or actual cups.  It is nice to practice a short game and what could be better than playing golf in the nude.  Nice pool, maybe a slight step down from some clubs but better than most.  \n\nThey have added a nice restaurant that I tried last week on my most recent visit.  The staff is very nice.

Then an additional small white rice. I get home and see hardley any chicken in the box. So I thought well there must be more under the rice...nope. So I end up with 6 small pieces of chicken and I mean small with lots of rice. I'm sorry but every time I have ever ordered this same meal at other take outs, I had so much chicken I didn't know what to do with it! This is the least amount of chicken i ever got from the 22 years of going to chinese take outs. Pretty much a ripp off from my experience. I recommend 7 woks up the street instead. Same or less money and much more food. On a good note this happy wok does have good food, place is clean and service is fast. In the end though, hey don't ripp me off and make me go to McDonald's to finish eating dinner. Give me a dinner and please don't leave me still hungry next time","stars":2}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Ah Belise! I adore your elegantly rustic setting, just perfect for a large group dinner later in the evening recently (I should say, we closed the place down, that's how at home we felt here). I was in love with the atmosphere. I'd come here just for wine on any given night. \n\nI made a reservation for eight people and notified them of my vegan diet because typically in this city if you just show up and mention you're vegan, you're not going to get anything terribly exciting. I totally get it. I don't expect chefs to think on the fly and come up with some exquisite sans the very ingredients that they prefer to work with (at a traditionally non health conscious restaurant like this one). What I do expect when I make reservations a few days in advance is to not be told that basically I could only get the ____ without the ______ which is what happened to me here. Not acceptable at this price point and if I hadn't been with a group, honestly, I would have left.\n\nThere is a daily vegetarian selection on the menu. This is why I chose Balise over several others that could accommodate my group that evening. When ordering, however, I was told the vegetarian entree (risotto) couldn't be made vegan, which is funny and weird because there are so many easy ways to make vegan risotto, with either tofu or vegetable broth. They do have an appetizer with cucumbers w\/a creamy tofu sauce. You have tofu on hand, why not use it in another dish? And if you're going to do a vegetarian entree, as many other restaurants do in this city, it's time to catch up with the 21st century and acknowledge that people with vegan diets exist (or at the very least, people who don't want their vegetarian entree loaded with butter and\/or cream and\/or cheese). I spend a good amount of money on eating out and at this point in the game (vegan half my life), I expect more.\n\nSo I begrudgingly ordered the one thing they could make for me, the \"baked rigatoni\" without the beef cheeks and fontina. As is typical when I go out with a group, everyone else around me is oohing and ahhing over the way the dish was actually prepared, with more beef cheek ragout than pasta (it's an app) and when my version of the dish arrived as my entree, I was incredibly underwhelmed. It was plain pasta with tomato sauce and a few vegetables thrown in. \n\nMy group was extremely happy with their food. I enjoyed my time here because of the company and lovely environs. Our waitress was a pro, friendly and attentive. That said, I won't be returning for food because I yearn for creative attempts at vegan options, rather than as an afterthought. I'll leave Balise to the omnivores.","stars":3}

Friendly suggestions from a local island resident of how this deli\/ice cream shop could improve:  \n\n1.  freshly fried eggs on their sandwiches - not reheated egg patties \n2.  offer real milk (2% and skim) and half and half for coffee instead of only non-dairy flavored and non-flavored creamers with hydrogentated oil\n3.  begin serving Nicola's doughnuts (Farrell's is missing the \"sweet\" part of a sweet and savory breakfast)\n\nThe staff is friendly and attentive and there is plenty of comfortable seating to enjoy a cup of coffee with friends or surf the Internet (free wi-fi available).

They (I assume) make their own shortcake, and then provide all the fixins': glazed strawberries, high-end whipped cream and a strawberry sauce. Every aspect of this was absolutely perfect.

There is an outdoor covered patio as well as the inside caf\u00e9 and bar area. Some folks may enjoy sitting outside, but I prefer the welcoming blast of air conditioning as you walk through the front doors.\n\nThe decorations seem to mirror the diverse menu options from the Caribbean, Central and South America -- there's a little bit of everything, and it's all nicely prepared. There were two ladies working the restaurant when I was there for a late lunch, and both were extremely friendly and willing to answer my questions about the menu. They brought me a complimentary plate of fried plantain chips along with a bowl of creamy garlic aioli dipping sauce while I read through the menu. \n\nThis is a terrific place to come and sample a lot of different flavors of the region, without being forced into one nationality or cuisine. It never hurts to learn a bit of Spanish and be courteous to the servers. They always seem to smile and thank you for making the effort to speak in their native tongue, and then they are quick to give you recommendations.\n\nThere were a number of delicious lunch options on the menu including churrasco steak, chuletas (pork chops), one of my personal favorites - Bandeja Paisa, red snapper, roast pork, monfongo, fajitas,  ropa vieja, picadillo, grilled shrimp, ceviche, and Cuban sandwiches just to name a few of the choices. \n\nI ended up ordering another one of my favorite dishes -- Masas De Puerco (fried pork cubes), and enjoyed that with yellow rice and black beans.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I would just like to post about the recent negative experience I had with my local Goodwill location....\n\nEvery year my parents would make me clean out my closet, and I would donate my perfectly good items to Goodwill for other people to enjoy. I felt great knowing that my old favorites wouldn't be going to waste. I recently moved to St. Petersburg Fl, into a new big city, and a much pricier apartment. I didn't have the finances that I was used to so I went into the Goodwill location right across from my community. I loved it. It was very clean, everything was very nice, and they had a great selection. I also felt great purchasing my items, and donating the change to charity. I purchased many things for my apartment, my puppy, and even atleast 20 dresses for myself. I have been a weekly shopper at this location since I moved here. Everytime I get asked where my things have come from, I have always proudly say Goodwill. Well tonight you lost a great and loyal customer. I have worked for Publix for almost 7 years now (so customer service is kind of my thing), and I have never been treated so rudely in my entire life. Before making the trip to my Goodwill, my boyfriend confirmed that the website said that they were open today until 9pm. We arrived around 7:30pm and I started looking at the dresses (we're going on a cruise in a few days and I wanted a new dress). At around 8pm there was an announcement that the store was closed and that everyone had to bring their purchases upfront. Not even seconds later a woman comes up to me (as I'm putting my dresses back where I got them) and starts TAPPING HER WATCH AT ME. It probably wasn't even 8:01 yet. She then proceeded to tell me that it was time for me to go. So I turn to my boyfriend and ask him if I should go up and buy the one dress I had decided to purchase, and she INTERRUPTS me, TAPS HER WATCH AGAIN, and tells me that they are closed. There are still plenty of people in the store. I could understand if I was keeping them. (Maybe it's because I look very young). It's almost 8:02 by now. I then proceed to ask her to kindly step away from me and she says no. SO instead of putting my dresses back where they belong like I was doing, I put them down infront of her as she starts yelling at me in a different language, and I calmly walk towards the door where a woman who looked to have some authority was standing. I informed her of the incident, and I also let her know that the website stated that they were open until 9pm (at which time 2 other customers agreed with me). I am so upset by this experience that I just cannot see myself supporting this location anymore. Hopefully if I decide to try a new Goodwill home I will be treated better. I warn my friends and co workers. No girl trying to enjoy a little shopping should be treated so horribly.","stars":1}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I was very surprised to find a number of different food halls scattered throughout New Orleans, and also somewhat sad that I only had space on my itinerary to visit one. I am glad, though, that it happened to be St. Roch Market on a Monday evening so that my friend and I could partake in the community game night and extended happy hour pricing at The Mayhaw. Board game circles can be super elitist groups, but the guy hosting this event was really welcoming and very patiently explained the Deep Sea Adventure game twice, haha.\n\nI ended up getting laksa and roti with chicken curry, but could have opted for something at Elysian Seafood. I notice that they Elysian had a pager system to notify diners when their orders were ready, but Laksa did not. I get that each vendor is effectively their own unique restaurant, but some standardization throughout the Market would be nice.\n\nThis place probably has a different vibe if you come for a weekend brunch or during a weekday lunch, but on that particular Monday evening it felt pretty empty. I get that you may not have a coffee vendor open into the evening, but it felt as if one entire side of the Market was just devoid of possible dinner options. \n\nAll in all, this wasn't a bad place to spend a Monday night fresh off a five-hour flight!","stars":4}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"After reading the great reviews the wife and I decided to make the drive from Clearwater to try this place.  I ordered the street burger with cheese fries and the wife had the arepa burger with sweet potato fries.   Im not sure how long it was but it seemed like the wait for the food was pretty long.  \n\nMy burger was perfectly cooked and tasted great.   The bun was toasted just right.  Fries are good and nacho cheese is always tasty on fries.  My wife was excited about the arepa burger.  Normally arepas are sweet but these weren't sweet at all.   She still enjoyed her burger.   I tried it also and though it was good.  Her fries were cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of crispyness \n\n This place is a food truck with outdoor picnic table type seating. It was 90 degrees when we went so even sitting in the shade was hot.  Probably would be a much better place to visit during the winter.   The drinks must have just been loaded into the glass door cooler because they were hot.   Maybe a regular cooler with ice would be a better option.  The price of the meal was too high.  Two burgers with fries and 2 cokes was $39.   For that price there should at least be air conditioning or fans.  The receipt also had a tip line.  They do bring your food out to you but thats it.  There is no server and you throw your own trash away.  Even though the food was good I probably wont drive 30 minutes to eat here again.","stars":4}

My two favorite rides were Falcons Fury (best drop tower I've ever been on!) and Cheetah's Run (I think that's the name). The staff was extremely good at keeping everything clean and due to this, yes the waits were pretty long but at least everything was sanitary. I will say I went to the Dragon Fire Grill for dinner which was the wrong decision. I ordered a Slushee, Beef with Broccoli and a piece of Raspberry Cheesecake and it was almost $30. My husband ordered a Burger with Fries, Soda and a Cookie and his was almost $30. The portions weren't even that big! I've been to Six Flags and they have OUTRAGEOUS prices but never even spent that much at Six Flags for a meal like that. I wouldn't go back to that grill, that's for sure.

The food arrived and his burger was very well done and the bun was so hard , I have no clue how a restaurant could send that out of the kitchen !  My shrimp was mediocre at best , what it was is frozen shrimp that was thawed and put into old bay seasoning and put on a plate with a wedge of lemon , small cup of cocktail sauce and small cup of butter . My rice NEVER arrived , our server came by our table twice only and then was in such a hurry I never had the chance to tell him about the missing rice . When it did come time for the bill he just brought it over and it was then I said that I didn't get the rice . No apologies were even offered , nothing ! The view was awesome , that was about it .

I liked the lamb burger here- but needs more feta. We've also had the mussels and they were pretty good. The beer is just OK and not really worth what they cost- they should support more local breweries... or maybe they do and I didn't notice? I had the veggie risotto of the day twice- first time was really good- mushroom. Second time, carrot. Literally just plain risotto with some chunks of carrot. Not impressed.

None of the entrees come with sides and the duck tacos were two small tacos that consisted of mostly slaw.","stars":3}

I stopped and was greeted by nice older woman.  My first thought when I stepped in was it reminded of a mom and pop establishment I would frequent growing up in Jersey, it smelled delicious in there.  But of course I was there to look at the lunch specials. I didn't choose pizza I chose the double cheeseburger sub with grilled mushrooms.  The sub was good but I've had better.  I was expecting handmade patties but these patties tasted like they were regular frozen patties you would purchase from Sam's Club, but the fresh grilled mushrooms took the sub up a few notches but I still wouldn't purchase it again.  My sidekick ordered medium wings and they were great and the reason for the 4 stars.  \n\nWould I return yes, to try other items such as the pizza which by browsing the menu the choices looked interesting such a shrimp pizza.

It's been pretty amazing the couple of times I stopped at Maison for food - even when it's crowded, we're able to sit at a table and get waiter service. No trying to order food at the bar and waiting for your number to be called, or whatever. In my experience, the service has been phenomenal, particularly considering how hectic it can get in here during the weekends.\n\nAs such, Maison is the new 13 on Frenchmen Street when it's late, you're hungry, and you want something delicious. The next time I go to 13 and they're tragically out of tater tots (no tachos?! but that's why I came!) I know what to do. Head to Maison for another fried eggplant spears po-boy. \n\nVeggie friendly.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Absolutely love this place! I had friends visiting and they actually accidentally discovered this bar\/restaurant while exploring the Bywater area. The location just opened around New Years time so it's brand spanking new. My friends loved it so much they wanted me to try it. Walking in, the place is sectioned off to 3-4 different locations which I love. There is an indoor traditional restaurant area when you enter on the left then on the right there is a beautiful outdoor area as well as the bar. The bar has an amazing Happy Hour which includes a bunch of $5 beers and wines and food which ranges from $3-8 which includes calamari, fried shrimp (amazing), nuts and various types of sushi. The final area is the upstairs area which has their own sushi bar. \n\nWe started the night with drinks at the bar since their main dining area was occupied with an event. I ordered one of the most amazing Sangria type drinks which was a combination of vodka, red wine mixes, fruits and lychee. We then went upstairs and tried all of the Happy Hour menu items.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBar nut: Actually ordered this on accident but it was super super delicious. They toast them first so it was warm and perfectly seasoned. \n\nPopcorn Shrimp: SOOOOO GOOD. Perfectly fried and they are really generous on the size of the shrimp. The amount was also quite generous. \n\nFried Calamari: Also Delicious. Portions are good and the batter was great. I like the sauce that it comes with. \n\nTruffle fries: I have a weakness for anything truffle but these were perfectly cooked with perfection seasoning. DELICIOUS! \n\nJAKKU Roll from the treehouse: I honestly couldn't tell that it was Vegan. The fruit was cooked and seasoned very well and tasted like fried tempura. \n\nPAPPARDELLE chicken: SOOOO GOOD. They hand make the noodles at the restaurant and you can definitely tell with the quality. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall, amazing place. I'm so happy I discovered this place early but I have a feeling its going to get crazy busy once others discover it. My favorite thing about this place is their amazing court yard. They also are starting Jazz Brunches on weekends with bottomless drink options!

So we went to Bourbon House without knowing anything about it, as they said the wait would only be around 30 minutes.\n\nThe food there was P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L. First off, I'm not a big oyster fan. I've tried many times over the years, with results ranging from MEH...to NOT BAD. But these oysters were THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. It was a combination of size, texture, and flavor! I'm not sure how they got them to taste they way they did, but I cannot wait to go back!!! My friend, who loves oysters and eats them much more often than I do, also confirmed that these are the best he's ever had in his life. They were about $17\/dozen, which is not cheap (at least not from my oyster standards), but worth every penny!!!\n\nOne of my buddies ended up having the redfish with crab on top of it, and this dish was also to die for! I ended up with Shrimp Creole, which was very good, but not to the level of the redfish and the oysters!!!\n\nThe service was excellent, and though the final bill was a bit high, it was well worth the money. I am looking forward to my next trip back to New Orleans and will make this my first food stop!!! If you are an oyster fan (or even if you are not, like me), you definitely need to check this place out!!!","stars":5}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I pointed this place out to Chau V. hence her review, but I myself happened on here after hearing of the long lines and hefty prices at a rival ramen place.  This place, though, brings out all the stops in authentic japanese ramen and sushi, as well as japanese-specific app snacks.\n\nAt first you may be put off by the really restrictive times of the restaurant. I would recommend getting there early.\n\nThe server that I've had twice has been the same old lady who only will come by when you are ready to order. Get it all in order because the food will come quick. Their is water, and bottled water, and coke, and mexican coke. with the exception of the tap water, everything else is in bottles or cans.\n\nI looked at the menu and immediately zeroed in on TakoYaki, which is like a puff squid ball or something... Its not something you see often in sushi restaurants, so I got that and the omisube aka onigiri aka japanese rice balls (those handheld rice snacks with fillings inside) and a tonkatsu ramen.\n\nThe rice ball came out first and hot, and i gobbled it down quickly. It is a triangle rice-shape with a wide strip of nori seaweed wrapped around it so you dont actually contact the rice with your fingers. The filling was a salmon meat. yum.\n\nThen I had a takoyaki.  I confess I don't remember what takoyakis were so I just ate them. They were tasty. The sauce accompaniment complemented the calimari-esque task of the lightly fried balls. \n\nFinally the Tonkatsu arrived. There were at least 3-4 pieces of hefty meat chunks in the soup and the broth was subtle yet flavorful. The noodles were soft and chewy; not sure if they are made in-house or pre-made, but who cares. Its tonkotsu ramen. There's only 2-3 places in tampa that have ramen. And this one feels the most authentic. \n\nThere is a minimum credit card charge but if you do an average order you shouldn't have a problem with that.  I've gone twice so far and definitely will go back to get my Ramen fix.","stars":4}

The flan was delicious--light and no eggy taste--maybe they use corn starch to thicken it instead of egg. We ordered paella and La Cubana completa (a combination Cuban plate). The paella wasn't the best we have had, but it was above average. The combination plate was loaded with pork and beef and the rice and beans were good. Between the two dishes we had food to spare--we brought it home and finished it off later! The guava pastry--maybe tort Carmilita--was absolutely delicious.

(With all the small businesses lost to Covid restrictions, I'd like this one to have a chance; it takes some time before the wrinkles to be ironed out.)\n\nCurrently, new customers save 10%, but you'll need to request the savings. (I learned late.) If you want to Pick Up, you can get a Large Cheese Pizza for $9.99. Local delivery is offered w\/ a $15 minimum order. The delivery charge is $1.99; delivery ends 30 minutes prior to closing. Visa, Mastercard, Discover, & American Express are accepted. \n\nWhat's on the menu @ this business that's open Tuesday thru Sunday? Nine weekly specials, as well as nine flavors of WINGS; my Garlic Butter variety (SEE PIC) was definitely DELICIOUS. (Wings range in price from $6.99 to 100 for $94.99.) However, mine were received w\/ blue cheese, but not w\/ the celery sticks listed on the menu. (The young man who took my order said there were no celery sticks available.) \n\nAlso on the menu are 11 APPETIZERS @ $2.99 to $8.99; 6 SALADS ($3.49 to $9.99); 7 types of STROMBOLI @ $14.25 to $15.45; it serves 2-3 people; 5 CALZONES @ $9.99 to $14.99; 10 PASTAS w\/ Garlic Knots ($8.50 to $10.50), & 1 Kids's Spaghetti @ $5.99. There are also 4 COLD SUBS ($8.49); 5 HOT SUBS ($8.49); 4 GYROS offerings @ $6.99 to $7.99; 3 BURGERS @ $6.99 to $8.99; & 7 DESSERTS ($3.99 to $5.99).\n\nLots of pizzas are available here! The menu states the following: \"Our dough is hand-tossed and fresh. Pies cooked directly on brick stove oven.\" There are 6 WHITE PIZZAS (12\", 16\" & 18\" @ $12.99 to $21.99); NY STYLE PIZZA @ $8.99 to $13.99; & 11 GOURMET PIZZAS ($12.99 to $21.99).\n\nI was not overly impressed w\/ my 12\" Cheese pizza w\/ extra sauce & extra cheese (although I was charged extra for neither). Not only was there very little sauce on my pie, but the sauce really lacked flavor. There was definitely extra cheese on my pie, & it was good-- just not great. Overall, my pie lacked the flavor I would expect from traditional NY Style pizza. After some researching, I now know that a \"brick stove oven\" uses coal. Artisan pizzas are often cooked in a brick oven, which uses wood. However, the crust was not an issue for me. Due to the sauce, I'm unsure if I'll try another pizza on my next visit. \n\nBut I'll definitely return to reorder WINGS, which are offered in these flavors: traditional Mild, Medium, & Hot; Teriyaki; Lemon Pepper; Hot Garlic; Butter Garlic; Fresh Garlic Parm; & Volcano.\n\nThe dining room offered just 4 metal tables (due to social distancing). It was sparse, but clean. Napkins were available on each table. At this time, all beverages are in cans & bottles in a floor refrigerator-- see pic. There are NO alcoholic beverages sold here.\n\nI wish the owners of this new business well, & I will return to reorder wings, try a burger, & eventually order a pasta, gyros, & a dessert.

And yelling at me at my place of business none the less!! He told me the cost was $12.25. I gave him a $20 and he asked me \"How much do I owe you?\" Ok even though I expect a delivery guy to be able to do simple math I proceeded to answer the question. \"$7.75\" And he still shorted me the $0.75. I ended up tipping him an extra $2 anyway just so he would hurry up and leave (Yes that would make it a 22% tip for driving only 1.7 miles to get to me) and no he didn't say thank you. Meanwhile he is still yelling at me saying I gave the wrong address because apparently they wrote Conti instead of Tonti even though I repeatedly said and spelled it out in phonetic alphabet (I'm a veteran). I even gave them directions and they still got it wrong. That didn't really upset me so much as the delivery guy yelling about delivery minimums and wrong addresses in my business lobby. Totally unprofessional. \n\nThe food is great but I am not sure if I would order from here. Something about bad customer service that leaves a bad taste in your mouth even when the food is good.","stars":3}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Will NOT use again or recommend.  A tenant put in a work order with property management about a leaking water heater.  APAC charged $1414.72 to swap out a supposedly leaking water heater and replaced with Rheem ProE50 T2 RH95 on May 14, 2019.  Once they left, the tenant had to put in another work order on May 14, 2019 for water leaking behind the wall where the water heater is.  They came out on May 16, 2019 to identify the leak behind the wall and to repair.  They found and replaced a bad tee connector on the cold water line.  Additionally, they replaced the cold water line to hose bibb and hose bibb on backside of house even though they said the leak was at the tee connector.  This charge was originally $1,013.81, but took 25% off after property management questioned the charges.  The updated charge is $760.36.  I will post an update once the property management receive answers from APAC for the questions below.  \n\nQ1. Was the water leak actually coming from the water heater or the wall?\nQ2. If water heater was bad, where was the leaking coming from?\nQ3. Was the water leak behind the wall caused by your tech while installing the new water heater?\nQ4. Why was an expansion valve installed and did the old water heater have one?\nQ5.

They sell pizza by the slice or full order but their by the slice or item is the ticket to this super cute location. They offered pizza, calzones, double decker, and garlic knots by piece or slice, which is always a win. \n\nI ordered buffalo chicken and chicken bacon ranch slices. My husband got the meats double decker and buffalo chicken as well. The slices were huge. I could have probably been satisfied by one slice but who only has one!?! Not this girl. \n\n The pizza was thin crust but unlike your typical Tampa thin crust, it wasn't soggy but perfectly cooked yet perfectly crunchy to the bite. The flavor was pretty good. I will say the ambiance of the location definitely added to the experience because it was small and simple yet felt large and upscale. I will say that I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken on the pizza due to the fact it was more like a chicken tender cut up and added to the pizza where I believe a grilled chicken would have been a better flavor. \n\nThe pizza creator Chris was super informative and really kind.

But most times, I have WWNO on the radio, which is usually on my cell phone.  I coordinate bike rides and other activities that I can do with head phones on so I can enjoy all my favourite programs, such as All Things Considered(4PM) , The World (3PM), and Morning edition week days AND weekends, This American Life (on the weekends, which THIS weekend was great!), and le show, which is done by The  SImpsons voice guy who lives in New Orleans.\n\nIf there is something that I am not especially fond of, I look for alternative programming, rather than go to a commercial station, or forbid, television.  I have been listing to WWNO and have been a member for YEARS.  Their on air staff is not abrasive or poor spoken like other stations.   I enjoy the depth of their stories and they make me think about what is being reported and being offered, weather it be information, an opinion, or a multi part, in depth story with regard ti a particular issue or current event.\n\nWWNO is where I leaned about Story Corp. which I have participated on two separate occasions, and it has enriched my life and that  of my families.   I also make a point of patronizing the sponsors  of WWNO such as Eat, Mat and Naddies, the Crescent City Farmers Market, among others.  Oh, Youngs' Cleaners, but that turned out poorly for me, at least I tried to give them my business.\n\n\n I think the more recent programmes such as Louisiana Eats and The Reading Life have added to my listening experience.   One show that I have not heard in this market (but was on an NPR affiliate in SD) was a programme on words and the origin of words and sayings, the title of it  escapes me, but if it was to be picked up by WWNO, it would be a great addition.   I would like to think New Orleans as a literary and a \"thinking\" persons city, but as we know, that is NOT always the case.  Listening to WWNO makes me feel a little wiser, more informed, unlike if I watch something incredible stupid on TV, which would make me feel dumb (i.e. Houswives of any location).\n\nI do agree with Jen that WAIT WAIT  is some what obsessionable (if that is a word) it IS a lot of fun to listen to.  I can only imagine what the host looks like, as his voice is a DEAD giveaway to his orientation.

The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because the service and management response to our meal saved it.\n\nWe came in on Sunday for brunch.  Read so many good things about this place, that we figured it was worth checking out even though it's pretty far out of our way.  Helped we had a living social deal to entice us.  This was our second trip here - our first trip, we showed up for brunch at about 12:15, and they wouldn't serve us brunch - this in spite of the fact that there was a sign out front advertising brunch until 1PM.  We missed the second sign, which apparently overrides the first, that brunch was only until 12:00.  This time, we showed up around 10, so we didn't have a problem (note the 1PM sign was not out this time around).\n\nThings started off okay.  Server was great - she managed to find the hot tea I wanted even though she originally thought they were out of it.  The menu looked great, too.  I'm normally not a benedict person unless it's your specialty and you have some good looking varieties.  Well, we heard another server stating their benedicts were amazing, and my girlfriend loved the sound of their lobster bennie, and I loved the sound of their brisket bennie, so that's the direction I went (with breakfast potatoes).\n\nIt went downhill from there.  First, tea came out in glass mugs.  Why?  They had porcelain coffee mugs which hold heat much better than glass.  Anyway, not a huge deal, but still unusual.  After that, a different server brought out our meal, but had no idea what table to go to.  We saw her walk outside to the patio with 2 plates that looked like our bennies, then back inside with a confused look, then back into the kitchen, then to us, so already we knew the food wouldn't be very hot. \n\nOnce we cut into our bennies, it was like cutting into hard boiled eggs.  If this is how their cook poaches eggs, he should be fired.  The server and manager acknowledged the yolks shouldn't be hard like that, so maybe he just got it wrong this time.  And I admit that it's difficult to tell if a poached egg is overcooked unless you cut into it, but you know how long that egg has been in the water, and if it's been too long, don't serve it.  Anyway, if that was all, perhaps I would have been able to finish my meal, but the brisket was some of the most dried out meat I have ever had next to jerky, and the potatoes were room temperature at best.\n\nAll in all, this was a 1 star meal.  Now, the server was upset with what we were served and offered to get us something else, but sometimes you just don't want to be bothered anymore, and besides, I didn't trust the kitchen.  The manager also came by, offered to take care of my benedict (we told him we had the Living Social deal, so there was no point), and gave us a $15 off card for our next trip.\n\nPoint being - from a service and management response standpoint, this place gets top marks.  The server and manager did what they could to make up for it and the problems weren't their fault.  But, the fact is that the primary reason you go to a restaurant is for the food, so while I'd like to say the service made up for it, obviously it doesn't.  Service saved the 2nd star from falling off, which itself says something about the service because the food didn't deserve 1 star.\n\nI'm happy the manager gave us the $15 off next time, but I don't think there will be a next time.","stars":2}

We explained to her over and over again, and she kept arguing with us and explaining how rooms are held. Of course she was wrong and gave us a sourly apology, and then was very nasty. We asked for a manager and he wasn't very interested in making amends. On two occasions we waited for over 45 minutes to get our car out of valet. The explanation to my husband? There's a new system and when the valet guys return a car into valet they don't want to input it into the system so they wander looking for cars. \nPoor service, small rooms, 45 minutes to get your own car, unresponsive management, rude staff-- all for the wonderful price of over $2k.

I was very unimpressed by the Fish & Chips. I was excited about the prospect of grilled rather than fried Fish & Chips, but unfortunately the Amberjack was tough & fishy, and the potatoes were missing the punch that malt vinegar normally brings.

He took the time to professionally respond in detail to each and every question. He also responded very quickly. Green flags all around. I never booked anything like this for a larger group and his professionalism made me feel comfortable with my choice to use his company almost right away. I booked the 16 passenger bus. Not only was Alex on time, but he came a little early to help is load the bus. He provided ice and water in the coolers. The bus itself was exceptionally clean, smelled nice, had fun lights, etc. The group was really impressed and mentioned a few times that we could have just stayed on the bus and drove around for the bachelor\/bachelorette party instead of going out to different places and had a great time. Alex was very accommodating and courteous. He drove us where ever we needed to go and was there to please his customers.

Prytania, the UPS Store, Fedex, they're all going to charge you for packing and taping. The post office won't even humor you). \n- If you're shipping something lightweight (under 5 lbs) or media mail, go to the post office. \n- If you're sending something heavy, or need to purchase insurance, ship it UPS (from Prytania or a UPS store).","stars":5}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"The best sushi in NOLA, hands down, and not 'deep fried shrimp & cream cheese roll' b.s.  If you like true, traditional sushi & sashimi, you will be very happy here, and they also have some more fun, creative dishes for friends who might not be into the straight-up Japanese style of sushi.  The space is well designed and has a big, airy feel, and the service was excellent.  We sat at the sushi bar and although we were the only people in the restaurant on Labor Day afternoon, the fish could not have been fresher -- not exactly what I'd expect on not only a Monday but a holiday, as well.  The sushi chef is very knowledgeable and personable, and clearly excited to be serving such high-caliber food.  I'm looking forward to returning to try more of the menu, especially given the excellent happy hour offerings - I agree with other reviewers that this is one of the best happy hours I've ever seen.  It's a little pricier than what you might be accustomed to (at Sake Cafe, for instance, which up til now had been our go-to), but you absolutely are getting what you pay for.","stars":5}

The same appetizers plates served to customers.  I have to tell you - this was a true turnoff.  All commented how gross it was.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"When I walked in, I jumped up and down and chanted, \"Portillo's, Portillo's, Portillo's,\" in a sing song voice.  Yeah, I'm 47.  What's your point?  And then the Portillo's employees, dressed in their olde tyme-y outfits, came out and did a choreographed group dance to the jaunty, big band music.  Okay, I may have made that part up.  But it always feels like that could happen at any moment when I am at Portillo's.  \nAlright, here's the Portillo's story... Once upon a time, way back in 1963, Dick Portillo opened a little hot dog hut in Villa Park, IL.  At some point, Dick hired a law firm to help with all the business matters that businesses need lawyers for.  And then in 1996, that law firm hired a receptionist and that receptionist was me.  Currently they have 60 locations and a few spin-off restaurants.  I'm not saying there's a connection.  These are just the facts.  Seriously, there's no connection, except in so much as I figured if Portillo's was my employer's client, I might want to eat there and now, 23 years later, I am writing a review.  \nA Chicago hot dog is a steamed Vienna Beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun, topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, bright green sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices or wedges, pickled sport peppers and a dash of celery salt.  And Portillo's is the place to get this manna from Heaven.  You can get it with any condiments you like; I just wanted you to understand the correct way before you went and did anything crazy, like put ketchup on them.  The hot dogs are classic, which is good enough on it's own.  But Portillo's went further than that.  Everything on the menu is good.  There isn't a bad thing on there.  They have perfect fries and I almost never like fries.  But the ones at Portillo's are crinkle cut, golden brown, and have just the right amount of salt.  The hamburgers are the perfect fast food hamburgers.  The Italian beef is dunked, not dipped, as it should be.  One of their milkshakes is thick enough to be a meal by itself.  And I'm not even going to start about the chocolate cake because I will never stop.\nTry Portillo's and you will be a fan for life.  Grab me a jumbo dog when you go.","stars":5}

However, this place does and lots of it.  It is located on a side street of Williams Boulevard, and can be easily missed.  The restaurant seems always busy but not overly full of people.  It is a family restaurant and contains a separate bar area located to the right of the entrance.  Large fish mounts, nets, and other nautical theme items decorate the wood paneled walls of the restaurant.  The main dining area is a large open area with high ceilings that can get lively at times.  \n\nThey have \"All You Care to Eat\" dishes of fried catfish, and crabs legs on certain nights. Those are their busy nights but every time I've went, I never waited longer than 10 minutes.   Parking was a breeze. They have a wide variety of menu items to suite your taste to include pasta dishes, and ashore plates (chickens and steaks).  Every time I go, I order the crab legs. You can get them either steamed or broiled.  Both are equally delicious but I prefer broiled.  The crab legs were outstanding ever time, and well worth the price.   If you can get crab legs anywhere else, you would pay much more.  The waitress can get busy but are friendly.  They stopped by often and was always quick to refill my drinks.

The tamale was very flavorful with chicken and veggies in side wrapped in a leaf. The Lomo saltado dish was recommended by a friend of mine which prompted me to try it. Lomo saltado is a popular, traditional Peruvian dish, a stir fry that typically combines marinated strips of sirloin, or other beef steak, with onions, tomatoes, and other ingredients, served with fried potato slices and rice. I thought it was flavorful as well and enjoyed both items. My waitress was well spoken to interpret the all Spanish language menu .","stars":4}

During that time we actually contemplated leaving and going elsewhere. \n\nWhen the good finally arrived it was just ok. We were missing bits and pieces from our order and didnt even care enough to complain based on how hungry we were at this point. The food was nothing spectacular and to me the portion sizes were a little small. When I think NY Diner I think huge portions and delicious food. Our server was very nice and that's where the majority of the stars come from.

My husband & I tried to go twice this week, but couldn't get a table either time. The 2nd time we did see an empty round table in the back but when we went to sit down, it said for 4 or more people. Just as we were about to leave a waitress yelled something at us but I couldn't hear her (it was quite noisy), so she motioned us toward the kitchen and then outside to a patio. It sounded like she said something smarta$$ about getting out of the way, but once I was face-to-face with her she said there was a waiting list. She told us we could wait and pointed us toward some empty chairs outside, but it was starting to rain. Who wants to sit in wet patio chairs in the rain? My husband said we'll just go to the bar to get a margarita and wait, but she said even the bar seats have a wait. WHAT? I'll admit we haven't eaten there in a few years (mostly because of the lack of seating), but they never had a waiting list to sit anywhere, much less a bar stool. The snotty waitress also didn't seem to care that my husband is physically handicapped and walks with difficulty even with a cane. As soon as she walked off we were completely fed up and decided to leave. Their food isn't THAT good to put up with all that mess. My husband also said he looked in the kitchen as we walked through and it was filthy dirty. We ended up at a new place called Cocina Aqui Tequila Bar.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This company is horrible DO NOT USE!!!! We originally spoke with Jose more than a week before the scheduled move who made us think he was giving us a 25% off discount and provided great customer service in the beginning. We hired them to move my fathers belongs from a storage unit in VA to FL. All items were already packed up as well as we provided a detailed list of all items and the storage unit size. The day of the move 3 guys showed up in a rented Budget truck (not an Irelocation truck) and when they looked at the unit they told my sister it would be 3 times the amount of the $1500.00 that we were originally quoted and that she had to give them $4500.00 right then. My sister had met them all by herself at the storage unit and when she questioned Vladimir about why we were quoted a lower price he began to get angry and started screaming at her then tried to force her to sign a paper without filling it out. He kept demanding the money and told my sister a check or credit card was not acceptable and that it all had to be paid in full NOW but we were told we would pay $400.00 to reserve the truck and when the delivery was complete we would pay the rest. When she refused to sign a blank document he followed her to car (where she was going to try to calm down and cool off) and was screaming at her the entire time. My sister did not feel safe at all and it made me fear for her safety as well. At that point, one of the other guys went into the unit to measure and walked all of my fathers belongs like it was garbage. After disrespecting my sister and walking all over my father's belongings Vladimir instructed the other 2 guys to get in the truck and they left not saying a word to my sister. While this was all going on I called their customer service number where no one would answer and tried to reach out to Jose, the guy we set the deal up with. After calling and texting Jose repeatedly he finally answered and said that Vladimir would definitely be fired for this because his behavior was unacceptable (I am sure he still has his job to this day) he tried to work out a deal with us to just pay the tripled amount but said that he is known for getting customers reimbursements and he would do everything he could to get one for us which I knew was complete bullshit. Jose's excuse for the tripled amount was that he miscalculated the size of the unit when he converted the 30 x 10 square foot unit into cubic feet which sorry that you cannot use a simple computer to convert the numbers but that is not the customers fault and I no way does that give you the right to rip off customers that already are stressed from the moving. My father had to end up canceling his credit card in order to ensure they did not try to charge him the original $1500.00 or worse the $4500.00. I have reached out to try to get the almost $400.00 deposit back because they did nothing for us at all but be disrespectful and lie. I am so glad they didn't pull the stunts I have read in the other reviews online and held my father's stuff hostage. After reading the other reviews it seems this is their business practice and I am at a loss as to where all of these good reviews came from maybe the employees have a weekly quota to meet to write fraudulent bullshit reviews to lore more victims in. In the end my father who mind you has had 3 strokes had to fly up and hire movers and rent a truck and drive it down ourselves. What is the use of hiring movers if in the end you end it doing it yourself and get ripped off along the way? You all should be ashamed of yourselves for your horrible business practices, lying to your customers, stealing their money and allowing your workers to completely disrespect people.","stars":1}

Actually, none of us are. Yet for some reason, no one even acknowledged our presence. Not the bartender who was a few feet away, not any of the 4 employees who hurriedly passed us many times and avoided eye contact, and not the person who I assumed was a manager, but not because he was working.

They received their cocktails - and still, we were not even greeted. \n\nI finally saw an employee and asked if we'd be served. She said \"ok\" and turned around. Nearly 3 minutes passed, and she did a quick drive by to say someone would be coming. At least 5 more minutes passed before we were finally greeted by our server. I use the term \"greeted\" loosely. There was no apology for our wait. But she did open up with \"fried food only.\"  My husband said that after more than 15 min of sitting there - it would've been nice to know that.

They have a lot of really neat snacks, food items, soda's, etc. As a diabetic, there were many items I could not have. However, I still found some amazing products. I bought diet ginger beer, diet almond roca syrup, sriracha beef jerky and a lemon artichoke pesto.

The only aspect I'm a little iffy about is that close to the swamp there is a little drop off and no barriers on the side in between the water. It can get a little nerve wrecking when you have small children.  Also,it's FREE!","stars":5}

It took a long time to come out, about 20-25 mins.  In the meantime we tried the gumbo and it was also ok. The 2 crab legs in it was a bonus.  While waiting for the main courses to come out, we had a visitor at our table.  Twice, my husband didn't kill it the first time.  It was kind of a turn off, but what's to be expected of this place. I didn't find out until I went to the bathroom at the end.  The kitchen is outdoors and they even have a smoker.  \n\nThe fried chicken was just ok, crispy but a tad bland and cooked nicely. \nThe rabbit jambalaya tastes like chicken. \n\nMeanwhile waiting, drinks are plenty and cheap.

I dropped back down and by the time I hit bottom, two others were pulling in fish.  Within seconds I was as well pulling one in.  For about 30 minutes, we pulled in 16 Red Grouper between six men fishing.  Our seventh man wasn't feeling it so they had put him in the Air Conditioned room so that he could get used to being on a boat.   Johnny and Captain Brad were busy taking off fish and measuring to make sure we were compliant with regulations.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Another terrific offering from this great restaurant group.  Commander's Palace and Cafe Adelaide are the other two.  I would say that the food is almost always interesting and very good at all three restaurants but the service and staff are highly variable to the point of frustration and my experience here the other night was no exception.  It was so bad the manager comped our dinner.  There's no reason to go into all the details, excuses etc... there should never be any excuses for bad service at one of these restaurants.  My rating is solely for the food as I believe it should be but I have a feeling this won't be a 4 star rated Yelp restaurant for long.\n\nI started with the apple and pear salad.  Green apples, poached asian pairs, autumn greens, Camembert cheese & salted pecan tuile, with muscadine wine vinaigrette.  Nice, very subtle.  Maybe some fresh ground pepper would have been nice with this salad but I did enjoy it.  \n \nNext I opted for the Foie Gras burger.  Pan seared Hudson Valley foie gras, sunny side up yard egg, duck bacon, & foie gras mayo on a caramelized onion brioche bun served with pork cracklin' & a mini Abita root beer and foie gras ice cream float.  I loved this.  I think it sat in the window because the ice cream was no where to be found in the float.  It was just a sad little puddle in the root beer.  No surprise if you had seen how bad the service was.  I know it says burger on the menu but it doesn't mention that it's beef.  There's so many different kinds of burgers now that I don't know if I should really assume it is beef at this point in our culinary history do you?  Small point.  \n\nWe ordered the bread pudding (25 minutes) at the beginning of our meal but our server forgot it.  He brought the check without asking us if we wanted desert or anything else and we reminded him that we wanted the bread pudding.  I didn't think this through but we ended up waiting for it.  When it finally came it was bread soup, lukewarm soupy undercooked and absolutely inedible.  I really wanted this but there was no way I was waiting 25 more minutes for another one.  The manager sent out a replacement desert that I have now forgotten about.  \n\nThis is an expensive restaurant, the portions are small and the prices are high.  The quality is commensurate but the experience has to be perfection in order to justify this concept.  I will consider returning.  It's really 3.5 stars for me right now.","stars":4}

We don't go here a lot but I got a hankering for potato pancakes and corned beef hash so we went here last Sunday.\n\nWe went later, after the after church breakfast crowd, so we did not have to wait for a table. I think the key to not waiting is to go really early or really late.\n\nI don't really like eggs so I went with the side of potato pancake and a side of corned beef hash. My hubs got the 2+2+2 breakfast and chose the potato pancake so I could have two (one to eat there and one to take home for the next day.) His eggs were done soft like he likes and like he requested, and his potatoes were well done, again like he likes and like he requested. Not many breakfast diners do his eggs and hash browns the way he likes them, even though he requests it like that every time so I have to give them props for that. They really listen. Also, the melon on the side was perfectly ripe.\n\nThe times we have come here I always look some of the omelette combos but I always end up getting potato pancakes. They do have a lot of varieties of dishes though so I think everyone would be able to find something good.","stars":4}

First thing I noticed on the menu was how inexpensive the drinks cost.  The food was also inexpensive.  We ordered the sticky wings, hamachi kama, edamame, and seared tuna salad.  The seared tuna salad and hamachi kama was good and flavorful.  The wings and edamame was also good, but it's not something I haven't tried before at other places.  So for dinner I ordered the tonkatsu ramen I've read so much about.  Since I like it spicy, I ordered it very spicy.  Meh, the tonkatsu ramen was nothing special and tasted like the same noodles that I could make myself at home with the little Mi Mama packages.  Most of my friends at the table agreed too that it was nothing special.  After dinner we booked a room and sang some karaoke.  It was fun but the equipment was kind of crappy and cumbersome to use.  All in all...we started the the night with sake bombs and ended the night with sake bombs.  I'll probably come back and try some other things on the menu since the food is inexpensive.","stars":3}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"A Hawaiian-themed build your own bowl place is a zeitgeist-y thing right now. They're popping up all over. I can see some merits, and this one might stick around past the fad stage.\n\nOstensibly it is a seafood thing, but in its generic fast casual format, it serves vegetarian needs reasonably well, with the option to mix rice and greens for a base and tofu on top. It costs more than other fast casual places tend to, but given the range of choices, size of bowl, and the avocado one employee (wisely) suggested I add, it isn't a bad experience. You can get a fresh and nutritionally diverse bowl.\n\nI would note to them that avocado, normally charged extra here (as in many places) comes free with a veggie bowl, but it wasn't entirely obvious (nor was it clear from their website and online ordering). Might want to clear that up. I was rather baffled by some other things. What the hell is a tobiko? Is it something I want to be eating? No, but I had to look it up on my phone to find out. Is their miso soup vegetarian or fishy? Again, I don't know.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"How sad.  Dropping Paladar from five stars down to two due to Friday's dining experience.  First let me say that my wife and I come to New Orleans several times a year, discovered Paladar shortly after they first opened their doors, and it is always a \"must go to\" whenever were in town.  I have always rated our experience as five stars.  Oh Paladar, what have you done with yourself?\n\nSince we were bringing friends this time, I made reservations two months ahead of time.  Reservations confirmed and I looked forward to sharing one of our favorite food experiences with friends.  We arrived at 6:20 for our 6:30 reservation and were met at the door by a man in dire need of a haircut and an clothing iron.  He looked like an unmade bed as he scrolled through a list of names to find our reservations.  After asking multiple times, and while maintaining a look of bewilderment, he exclaimed to my frustrated self and my nervous \"party of five\": \" I don't know what happened, I can't find it.\"  I wondered to myself: if you couldn't find it ten minutes ago during your techno search why did you make us stand here watching you in a state of confusion?\n\nAt any rate, to his credit, he did procure us a table and showed us the way.  As my wife and I prefer bar seating to enjoy the cooking show, this was our first time scheduled to enjoy the pampering wait staff catering to us at a dining room table.   This was instantly disappointing  as we were seated in chairs that were absent of padding or support - you know, the kind where there used to be padding but now all that is left is the wooden frame to encapsulate your posterior as that wooden frame begins to leave lines on your thighs.  To add injury to insult the two tables pushed together to create the \" five top\" were uneven leaving half the table in an unpleasant wobbling condition.  \n\nAfter settling in to a table along the wall, cocktails were ordered and wine was chosen.  Unfortunately, Sam our waitress provided a mediocre dining experience that one might expect from a tourist trap restaurant somewhere along Decatur Street.  Certainly it was a far cry from previous experiences.  Great service enhances a dining experience - mediocrity breeds questioning.    Our experience started with Sam pouring water, missing a glass, saying: \"oops, I overshot that one\", and then leaving as my friend Sarah used her napkin to clean up the spill! \n\nMost of Our appetizers were excellent and were thoroughly enjoyed.  The egg yolk ravioli is always phenomenal.  We ordered the cheese tray as I have enjoyed this selection on several previous dining experiences at Paladar.  This time the cheeses were great but I sure wish I knew what they were.  See, they were delivered and presented by an apparently undertrained staffer who had hurriedly tried to memorize the \"cheese speech\".  She was for the most part inaudible and as she got to the last cheese on the tray, she pointed and said: \" I forgot what this one is\".  Really?  Am I on Candid Camera?  \n\nSome of our guests enjoyed their entrees.  My hanger steak was perfectly cooked but I don't feel that the accompaniments heightened the dining experience as usual.  My wife ordered the lamb dish, which I tried as well, and neither one of us were thrilled.\n\nAll the plate sharing and dining taking place with a mostly absent wait staff exemplified by my empty cocktail glass and numerous empty water glasses. \n\nIn summary; not at all the experience I had expected, disappointing for my guests, and no longer a \"must go to\" on our frequent visits to the fabulous food city of New Orleans.","stars":2}

In that time, employees actively ignored us, avoiding any and all eye contact we tried to make. Finally someone said their were more tables around the corner, there were not. We tried to gain someone's attention, but quickly cut out loses and walked out.\n\nI have worked in the restaurant business, so I'm aware that things can get busy. Having some sort of policy in place for employees not to be eating in the limited seating available would be a start.

My fianc\u00e9 and I saw this listed under \"hot and new\" and we love Thai food, so we went for lunch on Saturday to check it out. The service was prompt and based on some previous reviews we got the Royal Dip appetizer. This was amazing! It's a thin dip, that tastes coconuty and rich and so good. It comes with wide fried wonton strips for dipping. We ordered 2 entrees off of the lunch menu which is a great deal- each of our entrees were $8 and came with a spring roll and a healthy portion of the entree. My fianc\u00e9 got the Paneang curry, which had peanut in it and came with rice, and I got the Pad Woon Zen. They were both excellent! The only thing we didn't care for was, I ordered the \"Lemon iced tea\" and it was syrupy sweet- I asked to switch out for unsweetened iced tea.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I've been to MassageLuXe twice. Once, at the WestChase location because I had a Groupon. The second time in South Tampa via a white elephant gift.\n\nThe thing to keep in mind is that MassageLuXe is a chain, and expertise is going to vary from massage therapist to massage therapist. I ended up with a good massage therapist for my WestChase trip, and I did the hydropump after, which was a little... weird, but enjoyable. Everything mostly ran on time and was smooth. All in all, I had a really good experience at the Westchase location (besides the upsell at the end, but more on that later...).\n\nThis most recent time was at the South Tampa\/Dale Mabry location. Despite having an appointment only an hour after they opened, they seemed to be having difficulties with the schedule. After I filled out my form on their iPad, they somehow flubbed and erased the data, so I had to do it all over again. I made sure I was early, but it was still 10 minutes after my scheduled appointment time before we started. For an hour massage, they go for 50 minutes, FYI, I guess to account for transfering in and out of the massage room.\n\nThe massage therapist, while she did good work, didn't listen to me. I told her about a problem area where I was experiencing the most discomfort (neck) and said I would prefer to keep the massage primarily to back and neck, and she ended up doing a full-body massage, with focus on the back the most, and only a little neck.\n\nC'est la vie, I guess. After, they told me the hydropump had a 15 minute wait... then a 25 minute wait... because I had experienced it before at the other location, I just decided to head out.\n\nThe worst part of the experience is the upsell. They do NOT take no for an answer. They were MUCH more aggressive about it at the WestChase location. But they still brought it up at the Dale Mabry location. I get it, it's a corporation. It's like the Applebees of massage therapist services, so employees are probably pushed hard to push subscription packages. But it's pretty stressful when you want to get a massage, say, maybe once or twice a year, to be pushed with all these options the second you roll off the massage table. I want a subscription to Netflix, not massages.\n\nDespite the pushiness of the upsell and the inconsistency of good massage therapists, everyone at both locations were professional and courteous. Unless you're on a tight budget, it might just be better to save up your $ for a local massage therapy business where you can take a one-off massage day and not have to worry about bad massage therapists and package deals.","stars":3}

When I was researching places to visit, this place came up as a recommendation from Alton Brown on the Best Thing I Ever Ate NOLA episode. I passed by on my first day and saw there was live music but I went to get my beignets elsewhere. I decided to head to Cafe Beignet for breakfast on my second day. No live music in there that day but a lot of live music on the streets nearby. \n\nThis location is small but cute. It does have an outdoor patio. The staff were extremely friendly. I ordered some beignets and chicory coffee. We sat outside to enjoy our sweets but it was very windy and powdered sugar was flying everywhere. We found a table indoors and continued enjoying our beignets. Yes we did compare these beignets to the ones we had the day before. My sister said she liked these better. I needed more time to compare, but wow these were really fluffy and super fresh. The chicory coffee (added cream and sugar) was actually good, I thought it would have a weird after taste but it did not.\n\nI thought about these beignets all day after eating them. I did return to the other Cafe Beignet location on my last day after visiting the other famous beignet spot and have to agree with my sister that these beignets are a bit better.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Pretty darn good sushi, friendly staff, and the ability to serve you fast when you are needing to hurry, Sushi Ninja can deliver with samurai like speed and precision. \n\nI work down the road on Kennedy, almost close enough to walk, and we needed somewhere quick to refuel before heading over to Howl-O-Scream at Busch Gardens. My fiancee was driving out from St. Pete to meet me at my office. Our selection was limited because we needed somewhere close and fast on a Friday evening. I really was craving some sushi but we knew Samurai Blue would be too far and too crowded. I noticed some familiar yelpers that gave Sushi Ninja good reviews and figured I would check it out.\n\nWe arrive and explained that we only had 30 minutes and we needed to hustle. That was difficult with the size of the menu. But my sushi short cut method is find something with cream cheese and it is probably pretty good. We went with the UT Roll and the Bagel Roll (Tempura). Both were exceptional.\n\nThe ambiance is chill and there is some nice electronic music playing in the background. The lighting was dim, but typical for a modern sushi place. The staff was friendly. The prices were reasonable. What really makes Sushi Ninja worthwhile is the massive selection. I will definitely be coming back!","stars":4}

I'm not sure if she danced because the food was so good or because of the bachata playing in the background. If you're looking for authentic Dominican food, Mang\u00fa is it. Drinks: they have a natural juice menu, cocktails, and beer. They have tons of appetizers. We had a complimentary empanada platter. (Shout out to my Yelp Elite perks!) It comes with five different empanadas: veggies, cheese, shrimp, chicken, beef. Each empanada was soooo different but equally amazing. The veggie and the chicken empanadas were our favorites because they were so savory. Those two sort of taste like homemade pot pie. I also had the bandeja frita! It comes with fried cheese, pork, sausage, chicken, and plantains. It's definitely more than enough to share, but it was so good that I couldn't share. The waitstaff is super nice. They explained the menu to us and answered all of our questions.","stars":5}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I visited the Delachaise a few times during Chris DeBarr's tenure and was most impressed.  Sadly trying to enjoy food or a drink in an establishment that allows smoking is a waste of time.  When I heard that the Delachaise is now non-smoking, I was really happy.  We returned to have several small plates, some wine and spirits.  Everything was pretty tasty and a couple of things were outstanding (Johnny Cakes were the best).  The glass selection of wines and spirits is (as always) impressive, not only in variety but quality as well.  There was no table service but I'm not sure if this is the norm.  We were happy to sit at the bar.  Service was a bit challenged due to the number of people who seem to come here to grab a quick drink before dinner somewhere else, putting the bar in the weeds only to leave it a ghost town 20 minutes later.  If you are one of these people, knock it off.  Come here a good hour or more before your reservations and get a small plate to hold you over.  This place deserves your attention.","stars":4}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"If Central Texas BBQ is what you crave, I dare say this is the most authentically Lone Star flavored option in the New Orleans area. Before we dive into my opinion of LA23's food (spoiler alert, its good!), lets talk about the Texas style. The defining ingredients are a relatively simple rub of salt and pepper for the brisket, along with paprika\/sugar\/etc. for more neutral flavored meats like pork and chicken. Then the real magic happens with an 8 to 12 hour smoke over \"post oak\" hardwood. This particular wood is incredibly important because it gives central Texas BBQ its characteristic dry yet distinctive woody note. Some people really love the simplicity in perfect execution of this style while others shun it for the Memphis\/Carolina\/Georgia styles which will use different spice blends and flavor woods.\n\n---ON TO THE REVIEW ALREADY!---\n\nLA23 has been around for a few years, but only in the last few months with their improved facility and dining area. Thanks to their increased capacity and larger kitchen, even the largest lunch rushes tend to only set you back 5 or 10 minutes. You get polite, but fast service from the guys behind the counter, and then away they go to the meaty assembly line for your meal. Within a few minutes of ordering, a styrofoam container filled with delicious meat and sides will be called out to you (the service is really that quick).\n\nThis go round I kept it smaller and ordered the brisket sandwich with an included side of beans. Having your sandwich \"Dressed\" is a departure from the lettuce\/tomato\/mayo standard of po boys and consists of a bit of BBQ sauce, slaw, and spicy pickles. The brisket was wonderfully moist, smokey, and slightly spicy from the black pepper rub and the dressing tied the flavors together wonderfully. My only minor complaint was that the sandwich came on a run of the mill cheap grocery store sesame seed bun, but I can't get too upset about that considering. \n\nThe beans deserve their own paragraph, so here we are! Bush's baked beans these are not, but one of the best side dishes I've ever encountered (Central City BBQ's \"sweet corn spoonbread\" is the best). These navy beans swim in a bath of sweet and smokey sauce with shreds of brisket and slices of sausage. They are definitely more on the soup side consistency wise, and dang delicious!\n\nIf making it down to Belle Chasse is going to be a rare occasion, and you just want to try what LA23 has to offer, go for the \"Top gun\" platter. 3 meats, 2 sides, and a whole lot of sleep after finishing are a great crash course in this BBQ joint's flavors.","stars":4}

I would recommend getting a reservation because every time I have been, they have been extremely busy, and especially with the cooler weather lately and their patio being so lovely, it will stay busy. They have an entire wall of draft wines which is a very interesting concept, and though I am not a huge wine fan, I can see how people would be extremely enthused. The patio is gorgeous with a lot of plants and it feels as if it is in the heart of the city with the nearby buildings and bustling street. I highly recommend getting the fig and brie cheese flatbread, the 3 cheese gnocchi, or the crab deviled eggs as the appetizer. For entree I got the Crawfish Grilled Cheese with a side of fries, and my friends got the Wagyu burger with the aragula salad. For dessert we got the Rum Bananas Foster, I believe.

She then told me she has to card everyone. I watched her take drink orders from others and no identification was taken. I even asked the couple next to us and they said they never do that here.  She gave me a drink with no alcohol and in a plastic cup.  She told us the glasses were getting cleaned. I watched other waiters bringing out glasses with drinks. Our oysters came out 45 minutes later and were delicious. She kept coming over explaining not to me but my husband that she was so busy. It's the reason you got a crappy tip. Next time dont be a jerk about the ID, crappy drink, plastic cup and slow service. We were there earlier on a food tour and loved the drink and oyster so much we came back.","stars":3}

Kayla did an unbelievable job, keeping up with the tickets that never stopped printing, the annoying 20 question customers at the other end of the bar, and running out to grab her customers some chips and\/or salsa.

Oh yeah I almost forgot, this place was super dog friendly.  I think the dogs got more attention than the people...I would say around 1\/3 of the barstools were occupied by furry friends, sitting perfectly well-mannered and upright at the bar just chillin.

Nothing tasted fresh, whatsoever!\n\nI expect a frozen\/fried taste profile and texture on any appetizer offerings.  Yet my friend's simple burger patty seemed to be a frozen\/re-heated one too?\n\nAnd the dipping sauces?  Just simple Ken's salad dressings from Publix have more flavor.\n\nBut I think Chili's should be forgiven to some degree:  it is, what it is...\n\nMostly a bar, pushing out enough cheap drinks so later the patrons think the just \"heated\/assembled\" food is real cooking!

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Ok, I am reviewing the Brandon location of this restaurant....\n\nI am a frequent visitor of the Tampa Palms location and love going there.  This Brandon location is their newer location, nicely decorated and much bigger in space.  I was surprised to see that they were not busy (no wait), as the Tampa Palms location ALWAYS had a wait time.  It took us a little while for our server to get our drink orders and went ahead and placed our orders since we are frequent visitors- knowing what we like.  We ordered soups all around and got those right away not long after our drinks.  I got my sushi (alaskan roll- salmon, avocado, cucumber, spicy mayo, eel sauce, opted-no roe) quickly and had to wait quite awhile for everyone's hibachi's.  The sushi was good, but not a specialty roll like their others and yes I finished it!  When the hibachi entrees finally came, my steak hibachi was nowhere in sight.  Also, hibachi entrees came out in a round divided plate (which reminded me of kiddy plates), with the food in their own compartments and sauce in a small circle in the middle, making presentation not pretty in my opinion, (I am hoping that's a lunch thing and not for serving dinner as it looked tacky. I have never had food served like that at the Tampa Palms location)  So family was done with their food and still no steak hibachi.  After finally asking 3 people who are \"checking on it\" finally one server said they gave it to the wrong person and another said they were making it right now.  Finally after getting our dessert and fried donuts, does my meal make it to the table.  I took two bites and had to leave as my husband had to make it to a business meeting.  Luckily, she had to ask if it was ok for me to take it TO-GO (which is a no, no there) and it was allowed since I waited so long.  The server was very shy and assuming-new since she didn't seem too confident in what she was doing.  Overall, food was great, hibachi presentation- poor, sushi presentation- good, service was sub par this time around.","stars":4}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Generally, I'd call this an OK mid-range hotel, with an acceptable location not too far away from anything worth visiting in the New Orleans area. I have but a few notes that justify my two-star review:\n\n1. The AC in our room was problematic. It'd be fine one night, then the next we'd notice that it just wasn't cooling. We'd notify the front desk, someone would \"fix\" it, then it'd be fine for a night. The next night, I'm sweating again near 80 degrees.\n\n2. Beware the woman you'll be shuttled off to just after check-in. She'll act incredibly friendly, and try to give you all kinds of helpful recommendations. You'll be invited to a free \"breakfast\" that supposedly \"all our guests like to take advantage of.\" It's at 9:30AM, and all you have to do is let them know which day you want to come to this lovely breakfast. Don't be fooled. It's a timeshare presentation. Now, if you want to make $50-75 via gift card for sitting through their presentation, it is possible to do so. We were able to get $75, but it was a hard-earned $75. It required a lot of sticking to our guns and just saying \"No.\" \n\nI think of timeshare presentations as affairs I can just snooze through, while someone plays a half-hour long video. How I wish that had been the case. Here at the Wyndham, the presentation is a \"workshop\" format, as they called it. You will be assigned one salesman, and he\/she will sit there with you for nearly one hour, asking questions, stroking your ego, and telling you how great and extensive the Wyndham network is. We politely declined after all this, thinking it'd be over. It wasn't. In car-dealership fashion, another salesman was brought in. Decline. They brought in the GENERAL MANAGER to give us the hard sell....they truly do not plan to let you leave there without buying a timeshare. \n\nWe were there for 90 minutes, at which point we'd had more than enough and just wanted to get on with our day. We made up an excuse of having somewhere to be, and finally wriggled free of the cadre of salespeople that had descended upon us like vultures. \n\nWe did get our $75 gift card. Knock yourselves out, if you believe this kind of high-pressure sell to be worth the reward. I might do it again, as it was nice to be able to plop down the gift card at one of the many New Orleans restaurants...but then again, I'm good at being an obstinate pain in the ass and saying \"no,\" repeatedly. If you are not good at saying No.....you're going to end up having purchased a timeshare. Don't say I didn't warn you. Just walk away from the woman at check-in who is being unnaturally nice. Just. Walk. Away. I don't necessarily have a problem with a timeshare presentation, but they out-and-out LIE as to what you're getting yourself into. They lie about their intent, and then once you're there, they lie about how long it takes. \n\n3. This place is valet-only, and it's $20 a day, paid in advance. I have a legendary hatred of valet parking, but since we had a rental car, I sucked it up and dealt with the expense and inconvenience. What this hotel does NOT tell you, is that there *is* street parking within a block or two, and it's fairly ample. In fact, I'd say you stand an excellent chance of parking within 3 blocks. If you don't mind walking a little, this is an option. If I was staying here again, I'd probably opt to just try parking on the street. \n\n4. The bed was spacious, but uncomfortable. Between my discomfort and the warm room, I spent my relaxing vacation in a state of poor rest and fatigue. \n\nAfter having written all that, I'm kind of wondering why I'm not giving this hotel one star.....but hey, the location *is* excellent. I suppose that's worth something.","stars":2}

I also had the chocolate pecan pie with Blue Bell ice cream per the waiter's recommendation and let. me. tell. you.  I can die happy.  Generally pecan pie tends to be too cloyingly sweet for me but this was DIVINE.  It's perfect for those who aren't huge fans of chocolate because the chocolate isn't overpowering.

And believe me, you'll want that lower temperature.\n\nThis year I met up with some people from work. It was fun seeing someone from Asia take on Greek food. To get the full experience we had a lamb plate, goat burgers, feta fries, baklava sundae, loukamades, two bottles of wine, ouzo jello shots, pomegranate daiquiri, gyro, baklava (sans ice cream), and of course a shot of ouzo to finish the meal.\n\nThere's nothing quite like sitting on the lawn with friends, having great food and drink while listening to live (Greek) music.","stars":5}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This is a brunch spot I happily recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to sit down and enjoy all New Orleans cuisine has to offer.\n\nFrom the moment you walk in until your departure from this restaurant, the staff does a fantastic job in making sure your experience is unforgettable. You'll be greeted with a smile, offered the server's recommendation on the menu and treated with the utmost respect and care. \n\nMy personal favorite on the menu is the Country Breakfast. The homemade, buttery biscuits melt in your mouth with an undeniably delicious freshness. The bacon is crispy and flavorful and the the grits are cooked to perfection. There were multiple dishes ordered at my table - Hanger Steak, Confit Chicken, Crawfish Omelet - and everyone was full with satisfaction. \n\nOnto my favorite detail about the brunch at Apolline - the bottomless Mimosas. Most restaurants that offer this great menu option give the word \"bottomless\" a more open meaning. Not only is the mixture of ingredients in the mimosa at Apolline properly balanced, the servers are attentive and willing to make sure your glass remains full throughout your entire visit. \n\nMy final tip - as tasty and delicious as the the mimosas are, if you haven't had a Deluxe Bloody Mary from the talented bartender, you won't want to leave without one. Not only is the drink beautifully constructed, the flavor matches the visual presentation. This could quite possibly be the best Bloody Mary in NOLA. For a little lagniappe, they even throw in a bacon biscuit to finish the lovely display.","stars":5}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"This review is based on an online order for a King Cake. \n\nI grew up in NOLA, but now live in Denver. Usually, I order my King Cakes from Haydel's. However, I needed a cake delivered for the Saints Wild Card game on 1\/4\/14 (I know, 2 days before carnival season) and Haydel's couldn't deliver it in time. \n\nThe cakes from Gambino's were delivered in time for the game.  Yeah!  Unfortunately, the cakes arrive undecorated, with the icing and sugars in the box. This, by itself, wasn't a problem. However, the purple sugar was packaged without a top (there was no top in the box, so it didn't just come off). Taking the plastic wrap off the box and opening the box, sent purple sugar flying all over my kitchen. Days later, and I'm still cleaning up the mess!  Luckily, I was able to use some of the purple sugar from the other cake I purchased. \n\nThe King Cakes themselves weren't horrible. Fresh, but pretty flavorless. The cakes I order from Haydel's cost $43 and are nearly twice the size of the Gambino's cakes which were $50 each.  I guess I'd order from them again if I was desperate, but not unless I had exhausted all of my other options. \n\nWHO DAT!","stars":3}

I was told the \"Tech\" would review the process and expectations of the procedure my pet would be receiving.   \nHere is where this company suffers greatly. The \" Tech, Dr. Or Dr wanna be\" (whatever this persons was), was mostly interested in up-selling me add-on items that are offered by the company. With each Item I refused, she became noticeably more and more upset.  I could only surmise that she receives a sizable portion of the proceeds she was up-selling? \nShe had zero personality to begin with and by the time she was done with me she was super uptight, abrupt, demeaning, uncaring, and sarcastic.

I've heard people criticize this restaurant for its ambiance and service, but it functions exactly as a quick lunch spot should. Located in a small plaza, Saigon Deli is surrounded by other Asian restaurants. However, it is easy to spot that there are constantly customers coming and leaving this restaurant. \n\nYou walk in and basically seat yourself; an employee will bring you a menu, drink, and take your order. After you receive your food, you're basically left alone unless you get the attention of a staff member. All table have chopsticks, spoons, napkins, and all the fundamental condiments. You don't have a designated worker, all of them help fulfill the requests of the customers.\n\nAs for the food, it is extremely cheap, plentiful, and amazing. I always order their Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup) and ask for extra limes on the side. I especially love this dish here because it actually has a deep, spicy flavor. You can also get an XL bowl for an additional $2! The portion sizes are generous, but the prices are so good that I always order a Grilled Pork Banh Mi (Viet sandwich) as well. Usually, I take the banh mi to go, and it is still good hours later. For a noodle dish and a sandwich, the total is only around $10.

Although I've tried to go to this water park about 8 times, I've been met with a closed gate half of the time. The problem is that nobody updates the website! I can't explain how disappointing it is to plan a whole day out at the water park after checking the weather and everything, driving over an hour both ways, and then being met with a closed gate because someone couldn't be bothered to update the website that they were closed! I've included a few pictures of the days in which we tried to go but were met with a closed gate.

First visit was for the burger and it is indeed a fantastic sandwich. It's served on bread similar to Texas toast (but significantly better) loaded with pimento cheese and drizzled with a super savory dark sauce. Not the typical American cheeseburger and downright enjoyable for its unique flourishes. But then on the way out, I saw the chef cooking up the sausage sandwich and I literally fantasized about that thing until my next visit. \n\nI think I overlooked it because on the menu it just says \"sausage sandwich.\" And in the land of hot sausage poboys on every corner, that simple text didn't draw me in. Seeing it in action was a different story. An insanely good marinara sauce with a nice heat tops a link of some of the best sausage I've had. Ever. And then some fresh shaved cheese on top. Just wow. \n\n I've had the other items, the pork sliders, the chicken, the ropa vieja, all good, all excellent value and generous portions.

My husband had to walk inside and pay so we could leave.  We got the Bahn Mi sliders for almost $9. We thought it said there were 5 on the menu, we got 3. After checking their online menu, we see it's \"5 spiced\" and there are actually 3. It was one sandwich cut in to 3 pieces. So basically, we got a sandwich for $9 that usually costs us $4 every other place I've ever bought it from. It didn't come with jalapenos on it, nor were we offered them as an upsell if they don't come on there.  Got the sample sized seafood pho. The small size doesn't have mussels in it like the full size, not even one for show, so that kind of felt like a rip off. Like really, if there was one I probably wouldn't have complained about this part, but once you start leaving out ingredients of a soup that's expensive because of those ingredients, you should probably add an extra description in the menu that says you bought bowls too small for the sample size to have all the components of the soup in it.  We got some fried veggie rolls that did not come with a lot of dipping sauce.

The Crab and Shrimp Grilled Cheese was okay. There was clearly crab and shrimp in the grilled cheese, but some of the flavors were not quite there.

The food, on the other hand, will make you wish you had eaten at home. My wife and I went out as a treat because we didn't feel like cooking, but the majority of our food was sub-par. I got the shrimp po-boy which was not a po-boy by definition (it was just shrimp on a crappy sandwich...no French bread, no Cajun sauce or even enough Cajun seasoning, and the shrimp was obviously frozen-thawed not fresh). One of the shrimps was even gray when I bit into it, and the sandwich itself smelled more like old fish than fresh shrimp. My wife got the Athena chicken sandwich and that was just so-so, with the overwhelming taste of feta disguising the low-quality factory chicken they use for the sandwich. The best part of our collective meals was the mixed greens we ordered as a side, so I wouldn't exactly recommend ordering food here unless you're completely hammered and taste is not a priority.","stars":2}

The dew makes it possible to to see the spots. So to even start driving in the morning is almost impossible from a combination of the spots and the sun. To even be able to drive I have to keep spraying my windshield wiper fluid and keep the wipers going.

It takes a really long time to vacuum the car out because the suction is so low.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"After a number of recent visits, all for lunch, I decided to make a visit for dinner. There is always a difference in menus, atmosphere, and the feel of  a  place when the sun goes down. And so it is with Sun Ray Grill. \n\nThe place looks and feels different. One place that changes remarkably is Feeling's when you dine for Brunch as opposed to dinner. All good by the way  and I felt a difference at this restaurant as well.\n\nTablecloths and special lights on the tables. What was so good about all of this are the specials that come out of  the kitchen. Last night was a tasty and delicious Crab Cake made with jumbo lump crab meat. An offering with crab meat and not fillers. Even the sauce on top of the cake contained jumbo lump crab meat. The way to go to impress me. My four star remains solid on Sun Ray Grill.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e has been hearing me talk of the Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad and decided to give it a try. Again the ball was hit out of the park. She loved it and could  not eat it all. Of course that was just dandy with me for I  finished what she left from the large serving.\n\nI am also appreciative of the fact this is a large place that also places its' table at a distance to allow quiet conversation without having to raise one's voice. \n\nEvery recent visit  has been with a different member of the wait staff. Each one has been so attentive and outgoing. And my water glass never goes empty even during busy times. Liquor drinks have been very good and with nice portions. The tea and soft drinks are bottomless and that is always nice.","stars":4}

They are the best oysters of any kind I've ever had, including Antoine's Oysters Rockefeller, which actually aren't that good anyway.\n\nIf you'd like anything else, get the Mediterranean crabmeat salad - it's to die for. Don't order anything else here (except wine, of course, or possibly the local Abita Amber beer). For all the other NOLA specialties, go elsewhere, and stick to the oysters here!

The set up is a little confusing for me, even after 3 visits. The food is good, but I find myself rushing to order because they are always so crowded and people are hanging out behind you, waiting to order too, and I just find myself ordering whatever I see quickly and then seeing someone else with a plate of food that I wish I had ordered instead.  Anyway, after ordering, there is always chaos trying to find a place to sit. Some people hang out and take up space while other people are jammed into small, uncomfortable tables to eat.  It is so fast paced that it is hard to relax and just enjoy it. The pastry concept is good, where you can add a pastry for 1.00, but I find that confusing as well, because then I am rushed to make a choice on that too. Here is the best advice, just get a menu to go or pull it up online and make your choices before you get there.... I keep forgetting to do that.","stars":3}

The Carne Asada has always been my favorite and it has been a disappointment in the past but is back to being delicious! My husband gets the 3 tacos and they were very fresh and flavorful. The margaritas are good again as the chips and salsa which have gone back to being complimentary. Then there's Amy...

They have the virtual bays where you can obviously play golf, but they also have other sports like basketball, football, rugby, soccer, and my favorite.. the Zombie Dodgeball! I'll be honest the virtual sensors aren't the most accurate, but it'll get you running around and it's such a fun activity with a group! And very affordable too, especially if you split it! \n\nOn the patio, they have corn hole and shuffleboard. There's Uno cards, playing cards, Scattergories, Taboo. & we all love the gimmicky oversized card sets. Those are always fun. There's tables and lounge areas for different sized groups, so you can pick anywhere to play. \n\nOn to the food, the nachos are a great choice! Platter is huge and the cheese sauce is a white queso that is pretty tasty! My favorite thing to order are the steak fajita tacos! You get 3 and they are pretty hefty and well portioned! I recommended it to a visitor in town, and they enjoyed it as well! Another call out is their roasted brussel sprouts, I have a healthy eater in my group and she seems to love it!

Mac and Cheese was ridiculous. and the cheese plate was good, but it was not necessarily my thing but maybe it was just over shadowed by the other two dishes.\n\nI would describe the food as rich.  Perfectly salted for me, but someone on a low salt diet would think it is on the slightly salty side I would imagine.  Overall, loved it.  they snuck me in at the chef's bar with no reservation, but I would recommend one.  Didn't really get that from the other reviews I read.  it was busy on a Wednesday night when the city did not seem all that full.","stars":5}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Combining terrific marina-side views and the downtown skyline of St. Petersburg upfront and center, go-to comfort seafood, and other American eats, as well as down-home vibes, Fresco's is a spot to enjoy both lunch and dinner with friends and family. Easily a spot where you can go for a mid-day lunch during the peak season or grab some wings or calamari before hitting the St. Pete Pier or some of the other spots on Beach Drive.\n\nSince the restaurant doesn't accept reservations, we had to wait a few minutes, which wasn't bad at all. We were seated fairly quickly on the outdoor deck, where the server came around to take our drink orders. I enjoyed the Honey Bee, which was a nice gin-based cocktail with lemon juice and honey syrup.  \n\nI started with a cup of the lobster bisque for dinner, which was delicious and creamy -- the right balance of creamy with a decent helping of lobster meat incorporated for a satisfying experience. I ordered fried the grouper sandwich was quite magical, and the tater tots I had for a side item. I didn't leave hungry; let's put the point that way. \n\nOverall, Fresco exceeded my expectations as a solid bar and restaurant for seafood and other bar food, with great views all around, especially if you sat outside on the deck as we did.","stars":4}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I didn't know this was a chain until I looked it up online, but I was extremely disappointed in the food. \nIts in the French Quarter, making it constantly packed I'm sure. When the three of us arrived it already was a 30 minute wait. I got excited about eating here because of how it was decorated in side. Made me think of Rainforest Caf\u00e9 almost. \nWe had our waiter, Thomas, and he was very nice and funny. \nMy co workers ordered the steak entr\u00e9e and I got the Cajun burger. We all were disappointed. \nMy one coworkers steak was so chewy she couldn't even break it down to swallow any of it. She ended up eating the mashed potatoes and some of the veggies instead. My other co worker who ordered the same thing had her steak cooked so well done you could just look at it and see how dry it was. But the coconut shrimp was good in my opinion.\nAnd then when they brought my burger out, I kinda got upset because instead of a Cajun burger, they brought me just a regular cheese burger. \nI told the manager and she took it right away. Within in about 2 minutes she some how had the right burger and brought it to me, cut the same way I just cut the other burger. I guess she saw on my face that I was a little confused and figured that they just put different things on it to make it the Cajun burger because she said 'Don't worry they just cut the burger like you cut the other one because they thought that's how you'd want it'. I'm not dumb, it was the same burger. What they did was take the bun off, remove the tomato and then they put the Cajun spread on it. Which was really disappointing because the description said lettuce, shrimp, crawfish and Cajun spread. This burger, I kid you not, had one piece of lettuce, and the spread contained tiny pieces of shrimp and crawfish. Not was in envisioned at all. \nMy co workers ordered a couple drinks too, and I had a taste of each. Very watered down. \nThankfully we talked to the manager and she removed a meal for us. \nI wouldn't recommend coming here if you're staying in the area. I'm sure the French Quarter has much better and 'new orleans' oriented restaurants.","stars":2}

It was good but I couldn't really taste the egg plant or prosciutto as it was overwhelmed by the heavy red sauce. Its a large portion and easily could have fed 2 people.

My wife mentioned it to her and she quickly without any problems took them to have them made again... unmolested Sandwiches please!

Fantastically deep, shrimpy flavor.\n- Pecan crusted fish (4\/5) - Only had a bite off my girlfriend's plate, it was well seasoned but not memorable.\n- Whole redfish (4\/5) - Nicely cooked, with some nontraditional flavors.\n- Souffle (5\/5) - Amazingly soft, eggy, and delicious.  Probably the best souffle I've ever had.\n\nOverall, definitely worth the visit especially due to the ambience, but not necessarily the absolute top of the list purely based on food.","stars":4}

Findings are below, to make it quick - it was fair - won't be going back. \n\nStarted with a cocktail or two. Ambiance and people were nice, I personally can't stand the 'communal' type seating with a shared bench and people sitting right next to me, this place isn't that special to pack people in like that. Heard the specials and ordered the mozz and tomato and normica flatbread for apps. Mozz was pretty special, flatbread was mediocre. \n\nOrdered a pork\/meat sauce special and a homemade pasta & seafood combo. I should have known the way she asked if we wanted salads as well that I was in for a shakedown. They bring out the salads, cheese over arugula with oil and balsamic. $22 for 2 flimsy side salads as add ons ! Ridiculous. My dish shows up with the homemade pasta a little too al dente, scallops cut in half to appear like there's more, and 5 \"clams\" that were actually cockles and hardly appropriate amount. It was a fair dish that could have been done great. My wife had some pork special, pretty much a plate of meat sauce with a side of pasta - later I see this dish was $38.....I can't stand places that pitch specials, and then grossly overcharge you for them since no one wants to ask him much when ordering go dinner. Then tag on an $11 side salad that they offer to you....\n\nHomemade tiramisu for desert, very good and saved this place to a 3.

They also host plenty of dog parents too with numerous folks having their dog babies in addition to their human babies.  This is more the way many of the regular bars USED to be before Katrina and the tyrannical Mayor Maoist Mitch started destroying our culture and the crazy Louisiana State ATF started their ridiculous garbage too which has caused a lot of harm to our NOLA culture and traditions.

We started off with the Fried Calamari appetizer.  My wife ordered the Shrimpers Heaven and I got the Forrest's Feast. The appetizer was out fairly quickly and was very good.  They also had banana peppers and fresh tomatoes battered and fried with the same mix used for the calamari.  It was all delicious. Our drink order was meh, I asked about their local craft beer selection(there's a prompt in the menu)and was very disappointed.  This place is located in a prime location with regards to several local breweries(3+) yet they only had 1 offering from one brewery the rest was your run of the mill beers(Bud,Bud Light,Coors Light, ect). I Ended up getting a tall Sam Adam's Boston Lager so I could get the Bubba Gump Souvenir glass. My wife ordered the Pineapple Margarita, it tasted great but was much more juice drink than alcoholic beverage. The main dishes come out nice and hot and were absolutely delicious. I tried the coconut shrimp from my wife's plate and it was amazing. I was blown away at how it tasted; perfectly fried with a light toasted coconut flavor. The shrimp tempura was outstanding as well. Shrimpers heaven came with 3 dipping sauces(Cocktail, Asian ginger and Remoulade). The Asian ginger sauce was something special. My plate came with strips of fried Cod, french fries, Mama Blue's Shrimp and Hush Puppies. We really enjoyed everything.  The food was great and the service was as well.

After purchasing \/ ordering in store they  ask you what is a good day for delivery and set up the date . So when they  don't call you when they don't even have the merchandise in the store to update you on the delivery status- it's really quite frankly very rude and unprofessional . I've had to call the day before ( with both large appliances purchases) to follow up only to be told the merchandise hasn't even left the warehouse and made it in transit yet! . I'm lucky I don't have to clear a day in my schedule to accommodate such deliveries but a lot of people do and I can't imagine how pissed I would be if I took a day off from work only to find out my merchandise isn't even in transit to the store.

Their pecan waffles are very tasty, and I love their Crab Cake Benedict (from what I understand, it's the best thing on the menu).

I ordered the honey walnut shrimp and what was supposed to be BBQ chicken fried rice.  I can honestly say the shrimp dish was one of the worst dishes I've ever ordered. The portion was a good size and so were the shrimp, but the \"sauce\" is a white goopy mess which automatically makes it un appealing.  I could get by that if it tasted fine, but again that was not the case. The shrimp tasted like they were sitting in a preserving solution and the sauce did nothing to help this. I tried masking the shrimp in the fried rice but in the end I just gave up.  The fried rice wasn't bad but it didn't blow me away, it was pretty run of the mill. You can get better fried rice at any standard hibachi restaurant. I also was given regular fried rice which is not what I ordered.  I know you don't go to most Chinese restaurants expecting impeccable service, but my service was pretty poor. My waitress was in such a rush to take my order that she didn't listen to anything I said. She obviously brought me the wrong fried rice and I didn't get my water, which I ordered when I sat down, until after my dishes had come out and I had to ask someone else to bring it out.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"3rd time here. The first two times i got the spicy kimchi (it was so good I came back for more) and I totally recommend it for those of you who like a little kick to your meal and if you love bacon and pork rinds (strange but it fits so perfectly) then please stop by and have it. Today I tried something new- I got the shoyu and I must say that it is now my favorite (I still love the spicy kimchi but I had to try something else) and it was beyond amazing. The Flavors just blend so well. For the appetizer we got the pickled edamame all three times. It's addicting and also has a great spicy kick. It comes with watermelon radish (it's good and looks Devine!) Their brisket and steamed bun was also wonderful. It reminded me of something I saw on food network. \n\n\nThe atmosphere here is also great. Around 5 pm the sun is setting so be careful facing the window but even so it's cute. They play awesome music from Michael Jackson to rap to pop to dance. It is very modern and quaint at the same time. They have minimal space but it isn't bad. Even though it gets packed it's very friendly. Parking is rough so you may have to parallel park around the corner but it is worth it!!!  \n\nI haven't liked a place this much in a long time.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Located in The French Quarter, seems to be a rival of the famous Cafe Du Monde. \n\nMy husband and I decided to try this place on last Wednesday around 9 pm. There was only one person in line ahead of me. When I got to the register, I ended up getting an order of 3 beignets ($3.99 + $0.44 tax= $4.43). With such high reviews (4 stars with almost 1300 reviews at the time of checking my Yelp app), I really had high hopes for this place. But I am sad to report that I thought these beignets were just okay. \n\nAnyways, after I made my order, we only waited 5 minutes for our deep fried dessert to come to our table (I was given a number with a stand on it to put on my table since I said I would dine in). Because we were with our dog, we sat at a small table inside by the entrance (it is crazy hot and humid in NOLA), but I am not sure if this place is dog friendly (although I think the employee who brought our beignets to our table saw our little girl, she didn't say anything). \n\nAfter having beignets at a place by my home back in So. Cal, I have been comparing all of the beignets that I have been eating to that because those are truly amazing. Unfortunately Cafe Beignet does not measure up (don't send my hate messages). I thought the batter\/ dough was rather on the thick side and I think a beignet should be light. I did appreciate that there was not an overkill of powdered sugar on the beignets though (unlike Cafe Du Monde, where there was just a mountain of it dumped all over each one). \n\nAlthough I though Cafe Du Monde was just average as well (I guess I am just too picky), I think they are still slightly better above Cafe Beignet. \n\nBut if you are in The French Quarter, it's worth trying this place and Cafe Du Monde. See which one you like better and write a review about them on Yelp.\n\nBy the way, there are restrooms available (the ladies' restroom is by the register and the men's  is through the double doors).","stars":3}

She was dressed in cheap leggings, disheveled hair, a worn crop top and flip flops. Her performance was dotted with pleads for money and an over the top dissertation on how they're helping the Hideaway by not charging more the venue more. Even if that's true it is unprofessional and obtuse  to say to an audience.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I've been going to this car wash for a couple of years, but only because I have terrible luck with car washes & I figure I'm probably just going to be disappointed wherever I go.  Well, no more.  Time to take it somewhere else and see if anyone can do a decent job.\n\nI pay for the Platinum wash every time.  The top option, without going into waxing.  (I occasionally get it waxed as well)  And every time, several things are overlooked or done poorly.  Among them, pick any 2-3 per visit: the door jambs are left wet, leaves are left in the bottom of the windshield, they move things in the interior & don't put them back, I have to find my antenna & put it back in myself, bugs are not cleaned off the hood, the windows are streaked from using dirty rags to clean them, and the one that never fails- the wheels are left dirty.  It's like they are taught what motions to go through, but not how to check their work for actual results.\n\nToday, when I asked the young man who flagged me down to claim the car if he would go back over the wheels, which were visibly dirty, he immediately told me (without looking) that most of that wouldn't come off.  Now, my wheels ARE stained from brake dust, and I know it- but I bent down with a dry finger, swiped it down one wheel spoke & showed him the black stain on my fingertip, and he just stared at me.\n\nWhen I handed him the claim ticket (AND a $5 tip I had preemptively included) & told him to just never mind, he then started offering to wipe them down again, but I insisted that he just let me go.  Then he started feverishly talking to someone else while I once again retrieved & screwed in my own antenna, which I found was broken.  It wasn't broken yesterday.  Then the other fellow starts offering to re-wipe the wheels, and I again insisted that i just wanted to leave.  As I got in to leave, the first kid started trying to clean the wheels.  Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot, people?!?!\n\nMost of the time, the customer service folks have a pretty good attitude.  This is the only reason I don't give them just 1 star.  \n\nThe quality of the wash has never been good.  I've even had them wax OVER bugs on the hood rather than clean them.\n\nIf you just need an Express Wash, they tend to be fairly quick, and you can't complain for $5.  But for anything else, I suggest you go elsewhere, and then let me know if you find some place good.","stars":2}

Decided to try it probably against my better judgment.\n\nWe did the All-You-Can-Eat A which has bulgogi (pork, chicken, and beef) and pork belly (samgyeopsal) among some other things. The pork belly was really fatty and juicy, but didn't taste like a great cut really either way. \n\nThe grill got really greasy and gross and we didn't realize there was a call button behind us on the wall so I guess that's kind of our fault, but it did impact our experience. \n\nAn older lady noticed our grill was gross and came over to clean it at the end of our meal, but we were done by then.\n\nOur server was a little scatter-brained, but he did seem pretty nice to be honest.\n\nThe thing dragging down this review is the price. $24.95 is expensive compared to competitors in Orlando and Gainesville and pretty much anywhere else really and the quality just was not there to compare nor was the selection. They used to charge more I heard, but brought the price down after people complained. \n\nI don't know why places in Tampa are always more expensive than quality places in bigger cities, but my patience is starting to run out with that.\n\nIzziban gives you appetizers, sushi, and lots of Korean bbq options for $20. It's definitely a better deal and the service there is top quality compared to this place.\n\nThe ban chan was very basic as well. I normally love fish cakes and kimchi, but their kimchi was very sour not spicy and the fish cakes were bland. \n\nI've lived in Korea so when I see mediocre ban chan dishes in a restaurant it's always extra disappointing.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I went so I get good a feel for the restaurant.

An employee (large white woman with dirty blonde long hair pulled back in a very messy ponytail) came out of a stall and walked out without washing her hands.  I was seated and sat for about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged my existence.   I asked a question about possible substitutions and the server looked at me with the \"deer in the headlights\" look.  I got up and left.  The place looked like it needed a deep clean.","stars":1}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I would have given this place 4 stars if it wasn't too hyped up for me.  I have a feeling that the line for this place will always be long no matter what, and it's just a matter of luck that you'll stop by at a good time when it's not crowded.  No worries though, the line moves pretty fast.  It's kind of a good thing you have time to wait because then you can decide what you want from their long list of menu items.  I would of course recommend getting their po boy--any, whatever meat that you prefer, and a sweet side dish--I got the bread pudding.  Price wise, it's pretty reasonable, and the way the waiter led us to our table was a bit confusing, but I wasn't too picky on that.  The Wait For the Food was Long though.  I really expected some mouth-watering New Orleans food in my mouth when I finally got my meal, but it tasted pretty average and the meat was a bit dry in my po boy too.  The bread was pretty normal tasting, and nothing was particularly special about it.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a horrible joint, it's just not spectacular as all the hype makes it sound.","stars":3}

I made an appointment yesterday for 5:15pm. I arrived at 5:10, checked in at the front desk then was told to have a seat in the waiting area and someone would be with me shortly. 5:50 rolls around and I'm still waiting for my appointment. The salon seemed somewhat busy on the hairstylist's side but I did see 2 or 3 clients walk out with wet heads due to the fact that the person they were working with had moved on to the next client. After waiting close to 40 minutes I couldn't wait any longer. I walked up to the front desk which was surrounded by employees who were about to leave for the day. The girl behind the counter looked as if i disturbed her and had a mouth full of food. I told her I had been here since 5:10 and she just looked at me like she had no idea what I was talking about. Communication between the front desk and the employees clearly is lacking. She could have apologized or even said that they can see me now, but none of that was done and i left. The salon looked nice so it's a shame I wont be going back.","stars":1}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Toups South, which opened over two years ago, is a wonderful restaurant by Isaac Toups that is located within the southern food and beverage museum.\n\nAs you enter you are greeted by the famous bar that occupied local favorite Bruning's restaurant which leads you to the open space of the restaurant.  \n\nThe menu changes with some regularity and the seasons.  We enjoyed a round of excellent cocktails and the menu features a selection of beer, wine, bourbon and other liquors.  \n\nFor starters we had the cracklins, an order of the BBQ octopus which was cooked to a turn, and the spicy pork belly crostini.  The cracklins were over salted - and it is a shame as they are really nice with a good slice of pork belly on each piece but the table was unanimous that the over salting of these made them lesser and we wouldn't order them again because of it.\n\nThe BBQ octopus was perfectly cooked and served on a bed of creamy, cheesy grits.  The bbq is a dark Worcestershire based sauce that is excellent.\n\nThe pork belly crostini were good and had a definite kick.  The thing to know with this dish is that it is not a slice of pork belly - it is a pork belly mousseline - which is unexpected and good - but the flavor of the pork is somewhat overpowered by the spices and olives and cheese - but we would order it again. \n\nFor our mains we had an order of the seafood carbonara.  This dish was the winner of the evening - nicely cooked pasta, the peas were such a great addition to the dish and the lobster chunks were just right.\n\nWe had one dish that was a complete disappointment - the fennel crusted shrimp shelved with a crispy rice cake.  The dish came out as shrimp swimming in a cup of broth which had saturated the rice cake and it was just pellets of rice floating around.   The dish just didn't work as described.  Leave the broth out - or change up the description.  It also lacked the flavors described.  As a newer dish - I'm open to trying it again - maybe.\n\nThe last dish was the fried chicken with a sausage and greens casserole - this was a large dish and it featured a homemade hot sauce dressing the chicken.  Everything was excellent - except that we all agreed that the chicken was over salted and it really took away from the dish and the person who ordered it didn't finish it because of it (and that never happens with this person)\n\nToups is an excellent eatery but the kitchen needs to dial back the over-salting of the food.  Salt can be added to a dish - it can't be taken away.  Seasoning is a complex art and consists of more than salt and when done with excess it can ruin an otherwise excellent meal.  This was a uniform concern among the table and we have a wide variety of experience upon which we base this.","stars":4}

After about 10-15 mins a waitress came by said would take care of us. Took about another 10min before she came by to take our order. Took another 15 mins to just get out water and finally drinks. The waitress told us that the kitchen was backed up (only after being asked and it had been about 40min) would have understood but we saw 4 tables sit, eat, and leave before we even received our drinks let along food. Food was tasty but she never brought out our soups, chips, and my sausage sandwich was cold. After 50 mins and we were eating I finally received my diet coke also. Waitress didn't really seem to care. We complained to the managers about the incident, amazingly another waitress even agreed with us to the managers. The managers apologized and stated would do something to help remedy the problem. Well all that meant was, nothing. We were still charged our full 93.00 bill.

Also, their urges were super small compared to other places for the same price. Lastly the supreme lost its shape and the cheesecake wasn't tasty. I would go back for the pecan pie but only if they gave me a larger slice. $4 or $5 per slice is outrageous when there isn't too much and it isn't the most delicious ever!

Folding tables, children's drawings on the wall, tray of spice condiments available.  Basic, but functional.  There aren't many seats, so I wind up sharing a table with a duck hunter, and we casually discuss our respective meals.  It's a friendly place, the vibe is TacoBus at 3am \/ watering hole sort of mentality.\n\nA *large* portion of duck fried rice shows up steaming hot, fragrant, Thai basil and chili evident.  Dish is upper-medium spicy but with excellent balance.  The duck is unctuous, good amount of meat & skin, plays off the red&green peppers (cooked but not browned, so not bitter) and onions (browned slightly for sweetness) nicely.  Good texture to the rice:  Not mushy, but not two-day old crunchy leftovers.  Sugar snap peas are bright, crunchy\/tender, add the right amount of bitterness.\n\nFive bites in and the tunnel vision hits and there's a slight \"whoosh\" in my ears as I start to perspire and cool off.

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Fun spot. I was in New Orleans for 5 days and it seemed like we ended up here every single night. Watching people ride the mechanical bull was amusing, and like most places on Bourbon street they've got pretty good drink specials.\n\nIf you're wandering around the French Quarter looking for a shit show, go here. :)","stars":3}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I had a 5 star lunch at Desi Vegas today. There were 10 of us there for our annual girls' Christmas luncheon.  We're a loud, rowdy group of ladies and we can be a bit much sometimes.  We were not only tolerated, we were welcomed.  Our waitress and her assistant were professional, friendly and so very efficient.  \n\nI ordered the Desi Burger and am so glad I did.  It was enormous, juicy, perfectly cooked and oh, so delicious.  It was served with Wickle pickles - a totally new one on me, and I loved them!! - and with the most delicious house made potato chips I've ever had.  The beef was tender and seasoned perfectly, and the bun was fluffy but rich if that makes sense. \n\nThe restaurant is tastefully decorated and there's also an impressive drink menu. I wasn't able to partake today as I had mommy commitments later in the day, but next visit, and there will def be a next visit, I'll have a cocktail.\n\nParking is validated as well.  \n\nI'm going to be adding DV to my rotation.","stars":5}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I honestly do not know why this place has such great reviews. I was excited to come here for the supposedly stellar views, food, and drinks. We came on a Sunday morning for brunch. First noticed the decor was bland and almost looked like a dorm lounge. The porch was really just a very cramped little hallway. The views are nice, but it's not a high rise view as was advertised in an article I read about this place. The cramped space made it less than enjoyable to sit out there though. When we arrived many tables were a mess. We asked for the available table outside to be bussed they said yes but then never did it. We ended up moving all the dishes and plates to another table ourselves. We ended up staying over 2 hours and they only got around to cleaning it at the very end!  The service was lack luster. Slow. We also asked for water multiple times before we were brought any. The drinks were good. The food was just okay, but overpriced. I really wanted to like this place but I will not be back.","stars":1}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I went in to mad hatter cause I needed some work done on my car that I had just bought. It ended up being more than I anticipated but they worked everything out to where it wouldn't break my bank (that day) and I couldn't thank them enough for getting my car safe to drive around. They were nice, reasonably priced and told me everything up front. 10\/10 would recommend to anyone who needs work done on their car.","stars":4}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Traffic Ticket rhino has wonderful customer service, but they are SUPER EXPENSIVE. When you're at top of the list like they are, you have the luxury of charging whatever you want.\n\nAnyways, I had two tickets and failed to appear in court and I called for a quote and they put in an hour or so of research on my case for free! I feel bad that I didn't go with them because they were super polite and on top of their game, but when they finally gave me a quote, it was $2,500!\n\nI decided to call around and I found another guy who did it for $375 and fixed everything in 2 hours! I didn't even have to go to court.","stars":3}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"It only took one time for me to go to these guys...  a couple of years back, to continue to return to them.  I have always had nothing but the Best service,  as well as Understanding. Recently I took not just One Vehicle to them, BUT THREE In One Week All for New Tires and One Alignment.  On the last vehicle  ( for tires) an unforeseen issue happened.   It only took a matter of a few quick minutes and discussion before it was resolved.  I Will ALWAYS Bring my Tire Needs and Alignments To THIS TEAM!   THANKS GUYS!  TRULY APPRECIATE YOU!","stars":5}

{"region":"SOUTH","text":"Slow ass service & mediocre food.  we ate here for my sister's husbands birthday.  We thought the service would be quick but it was incredibly slow.  The food was not that great.  I got the lobster bisque and the short ribs.  both were not that great. the short ribs were terrible.  it was short ribs with grits. gross!  I would not recommend this place.  I've been here for so long that I feel like I am in prison.","stars":1}
{"region":"SOUTH","text":"I read reviews before came but those reviews were right!! Best beignets ever!! Flaky beignets like croissant and buttery and creamy praline stuffing inside.  I would say better than cafe de mondo beignets.  I was there Christmas Eve so I didn't expect they were open but they were.  I got yummy praline and best beignets.  I should get savory one too.  But maybe next time","stars":5}
