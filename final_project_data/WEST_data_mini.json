They really know how to make great cocktails with legitimate skill - try the Old Fashioned - but I loved their two burgers for $12 deal, and we also had the Reuben Egg Rolls. Fucking genius.","stars":4}
{"region":"WEST","text":"This is a wonderful spot for brunch. The outdoor seating overlooks the water. Halfway through our meal, they started playing music. I love the ambience created with the music. They allow dogs outside and even brought a water bowl for my dog. There is a small parking lot, but if you go early enough there is some street parking as well. Otherwise, it might be a little hard to find parking. They have all the standard breakfast foods and they bring out the muffins while we were waiting for the food. The little muffins are amazing!!! I would come here just for the view and the muffins. We ordered an omelette, French toast, egg benedict, and chads huevos rancheros. The huevos rancheros was our favorite. We highly recommend this place for brunch.","stars":5}
{"region":"WEST","text":"We ordered Mark's Big Breakfast, I think it was called. Pancakes, hash browns, toast, sausage, bacon, eggs. Plus, strawberry lemonade. For the amount of food, minus Door Dash and the City of Tucson gouging us mightily, it was a good price. Good food. It's going to take some time to finish it. Probably should have ordered just the one breakfast for the both of us! As it is, it is going to be a big dinner, too! And\/or maybe breakfast for tomorrow. \nThe food was not so great that I would rave about it, but, you know ... there is only so much you can do with such things. I will say that the eggs were cooked just the right amount.  What really got me and makes me think I will be ordering from them again is that this was the most thoughtfully packed order I have ever seen. They took each breakfast and put that full breakfast in a separate bag with its own butter and syrup, and a package of utensils with a napkin and some pepper, I believe it was. And, the pancakes were in a separate container from the rest, with the rest being rather artfully set so as to not get too jumbled during transport.  Most places we order from, we are lucky if the food isn't just slopped in with bits running into each other, where it shows up looking like they pulled it out of the trash or something. So, yeah ... I am way happy with this place!","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"We have tried Esau's several times because it's a fun place, retro beach look, with big comfy booths. But the food always leaves us complaining. Their pancakes look good and have lots of butter, but are so stodgy and dry, you literally have to drink coffee or water to get that first bite down. Pretty flavorless too. The sausage is not special, just sort of flattened, cheap quality type. Eggs are fine, but it irks me that they charge $2 more to sub egg whites. On to lunch... I had the grilled veggie salad, which was inedible. The veggies were a mushy mess and the lettuce was limp. I sent it back. I then got the tuna sandwich, which was dry and almost tasteless. I left most of it. My hubby isn't a picky eater, but even he complains about things that should be no-brainers, like chili or chowder, and the fish sandwich. I think part of the problem is they have a massive menu; fewer items might make it easier to make things tasty. The prices are just too high for the quality ($17 for lox and bagel?!?). The reason for two stars is the coffee is good and service is above par; the waitresses are very friendly and responsive.","stars":2}

Although, I would love the lighting to be a bit on the bright side. There are some areas that gets too dark, particularly towards the back. I guess that's lover's area! LOL!\n\nThe food was good but I wasn't wowed by it. I've tasted way better ones in the bay area. The curry lacks the richness and complexity I got so used to. It does taste clean and not greasy which I like. The portion was slightly smaller than what I expected. Of all the dish we ordered, the papaya salad stands out. It has a small basket of rice which makes you wonder why. Once you mix it with the salad, it makes a lot of sense. The Tom Kha Gai was very good too. The Panang Beef lacks Beef!

Walking through the casino I was transported back to a recent trip to Vegas... it's opulent, huge and sprawling. So big in fact, we got lost trying to find the pool.\n\nThe party was like something out of Spring Break on MTV. DJ's were playing, people were dancing in their swimsuits everywhere, there was a lot of booze and who knows what else, and people were tossing beach balls around the pool. It was a combination of see-and-be-seen, and dancing with wild abandon. \n\nWhile I'm not normally the night-clubbing type (I prefer underground to Top 40 stuff), it was great people watching and dancing in a pool in my swimsuit was a new experience that I enjoyed. 5:00 marked the party's end, and the Starbucks in the Casino sobered me up enough for the drive home.\n\nApparently the Casino will be throwing these parties throughout the summer. If you are open-minded and enjoy groups like LA Riots, I suggest checking this party out.","stars":4}

The corn bread was really good; sauces were okay.  All in all it seemed like decent quality food, but to me, somewhat dependant upon where you are in line.  If they get down to the dregs of the meat, they're serve it to you.  Beer selection was good, and everyone in our party (4 of us) were very happy with what we got.

Where else would I go? Maybe not to this location. Not anymore. Maybe another location. \n\nI don't want to come down too hard on this location, because I don't suppose they're doing anything really wrong, but I felt sort of wronged when I took my car in last week. I just needed them to see if I had a leak in my tire. 30 minutes goes by. Everyone in the lobby when I arrived leaves. A new batch of customers arrive. 30 minutes later they're gone. I'm still waiting. Another hour, three Phoenix magazines, and seven rage texts to my husband and still, nothing. Yes, they were busy, but clearly not busy enough to service anyone who came in after I did. It was kind of a real bummer. \n\nDiscount Tire, you don't have to give my priority, but how about some reassurance when inspecting a tire takes almost two hours?

{"region":"WEST","text":"I was in Tucson for a conference, and I had a great stay here. Marisa was super-friendly when I checked in, and seemed to genuinely care that I would be comfortable, get some good sleep, and have a good cocktail at the bar. Clay, the bartender, helped me pick something. I have never stayed at an aloft, so I was surprised that the room had more of the classic touches. I was seriously concerned that it would be too modern and hipster for me. However, only the elevator was really like that...so that decor was weird. But hey, how long are you in the elevator? I liked the closet and bathroom setup for unpacking and managing my things. Although, I was just about to call downstairs and ask why I didn't have a refrigerator when I found it under the vanity sink. So, that's a little weird to me, and I think that the clean lines they they want in the decor of the sleeping and desk area may be more the reason, unless there's really an electrical or plumbing reason for that. It's minor compared to how nice everyone was and how nice the room is.","stars":5}

Usually I'll get the two meat combo which comes with your choice of several bbq meats, two sides, corn bread, and a piece of Texas toast. Must haves: you must try the Mac n cheese as it is the best I've ever had! It's made with small bits of jalape\u00f1o (but not too much as I'm not a big spicy fan), bits of corn, and lots of different cheeses. I can assure you that if you've had it once you will come back for more! The banana pudding is so creamy delicious, and comes in a huge portion, so if you're looking for a good dessert to split between the family I highly recommend this! As far as meats: the brisket is is tender and my absolute favorite, the Georgia pulled pork is delicious, the ribs are fantastic (they've won contests for these), the bbq chicken is tender and juicy, and the spicy sausage is another great one. I've had multiple servers at this location, all of which have been wonderful; most recently had James W and Natalija both of whom are very attentive and friendly.

Dina, Jordan, and the entire staff at Viva were simply wonderful. \n\nI had initially run into trouble when looking for a space that would host a smaller (yet very important to us!) event in Santa Barbara. I was surprised by this. Some venues shut me down immediately as they would not host a group less than 30 or for less than $6k or other ridiculous conditions. Some never even responded to me.

We went this past Saturday, May 8 which was their soft opening. A lot can go wrong on opening day, but they did really well. We went early in hopes of being able to get in. It was starting to really get crowded right about when we were leaving so I don't know how the rest of the soft opening went. Staff seemed a little hurried, but I know it can be one of those things where you really have to feel out the place and the pace needed. It will smooth out.\n\nI had their Thai iced tea which I always like. It is sweet though so I can't do it every time. Husband had regular unsweetened tea. Now these people know how to make tea. It was very dark and flavorful, not tea that looks like a tea bag had just quickly been dragged through water. We get lime in our Ice tea and the coloring even stained the lime. Worth it!\n\nI had the Pumpkin curry with chicken which was great. Husband had the Pad Thai with shrimp. Also great with good sticky rice noodles.

Service was meh. \n\nWe were seated and within about 5 minutes a lady came by to get our drink orders. That was the last we saw of anyone for about 20 minutes. Then our soft drinks came, but bar drinks still not there. We placed our dinner order at that point because we were starving. About another 15 minutes food comes out. Keep in mind, almost 40 minutes and we STIL haven't got the drinks from the bar. Waitress said 'They're backed up\". How on earth do you get backed up THAT long? We could have walked to the ABC store and come back and still beat the bartender. Finally drinks came, but were made wrong. We didn't say anything because at the rate they come out, we'd be finished eating and in bed before they hit the table.\n\nTook forever to check out and leave also.

I ate a Buenos taco and a carne asada (like) taco tonight and it was fast food quality, as usual. Step it up, for once in years, or sell please! We want good fish tacos.","stars":2}
{"region":"WEST","text":"Let me preface this review with the ONLY reason I gave them one star is because I can't give anything less.   My place of business orders  take out from here often and most of the time the food quality is decent but there have been many forgotten items such as sides of french onion soup and side salads.  We just write it off as a mistake but we don't even order from here anymore because it has gotten so bad.   So therefore this place deserves one star.  This really bums me out because I live out here in Sparks.  I WANT places to succeed out here and stay open.  I have seen one too many establishments close down in Spanish Springs and it truly bums me out.  But somehow this place stays strong even with the many times I have had messed up to-go orders and this following in-house dining experience has pushed me away from Red Robin for good. \n\nI am not sure what the problem is but my gosh...unreal.  Get your act together.  For one, their gluten free menu is online only.  Seriously!  My son has celiac and in order to eat dinner here with him I have to download the app and look at your GF menu online?  After being told by a snarky teen that I could only view this menu online my daughter spent about 10 minutes trying to download and navigate the GF menu.  Once we had it downloaded it was still unclear as to what entrees were completely GF.   Waiting for items to download on an iPhone so you can order is just downright ridiculous.  \n\nWe came here on a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm.  It was not busy by any means.  We were seated and it took about 5-10 minutes to be acknowledged.  The server  took our drink order and left.  She did not write anything down during our entire  visit and she REALLY needs to.  A list of things she forgot:\n\n1. a kids apple juice\n2. a side of jalape\u00f1o peppers\n3. my mom's entire lunch\n4. drinks were completely messed up.\n5. My son has celiac so I ordered a side of apples, those were forgotten\n6. My daughters side of fruit\n7. asked for no sour cream or cheese in the soup and there was a large dollop and cheese floating around in the soup. \n8. we were given 3 place settings and there were six of us. It took a while to get someone flagged down.  Once we did get the attention of wait staff it was as if we asked them to donate a kidney to get more napkins and place settings.\n9.  The worst part was that we went to THIS ESTABLISHMENT because my son has autism and is quite tough to take to a restaurant.  It is a rare occasion that we do so.  I thought Red Robin would be a great choice being that they are supposed to cater to kids and families.  \n\n When we placed our order, we told the server it was my son's birthday.  She said ok no problem.  She COMPLETELY forgot his birthday.  All around us people were getting sung to and \"happy birthday'ed\".  Nope.  Forgot his.  I would've reminded her but by the time we got our bill and food along with everything that was forgotten we (and my son) were just ready to go.  On the way out my son-in-law said to the server \"You forgot his birthday\"...to this she said \"Oh I am sorry\".  Nice.  Class act.  \n\nWe will NEVER go to this Red Robin again.  The service is just downright awful.  It is a shame because I know there are other RR establishments that are deserving of more stars but I will avoid the Sparks establishment.  No more take out for my workplace and definitely no more in-house visits.","stars":1}

Prior to this past arriving this last visit, I had been trying to decide between the porterhouse and the chicken fried chicken, but we went around 2pm and neither were available, so I had to \"settle\" for the filet - which was a little smaller than I wanted, but fantastic and perfectly grilled.  Both times we've been there, the owner swung by the table and told my kids that if they ate all their food (to parental satisfaction), he'd bring them out some ice cream (if it was alright with the parents).  One of my kids actually turned it down because she didn't want to stop eating her meal!  We also had our baby with us and, after seeing him eating Gerber puffs, the owner offered to bring out a small scoop of mac and cheese.  He brought out a dish of it, plus a little brisket, and my baby DESTROYED every bit of it!

WAAAY better.\n\nBut, you see, the only reason I know that is because the terrific offers the GSR used to provide in the past made it my \"GO TO\" Reno place for years.  Then you cut off my offers and wanted to start charging me like I was a nobody.\n\nAnd shoved me straight into the waiting arms of the Atlantis.\n\nThis was driven home again to me the other day when I got an email from GSR marketing, telling me they would appreciate my vote for \"USA Today 10 Best Readers' Choice 2018\" awards in the \"Best Casino Outside of Las Vegas\" category. And, I guess to make it convenient (?) they let me know that I could use the email to vote every day.\n\nRight. (Incredulous sideways glance).\n\nSo I fired off the following email back to them:\n\nYour kidding. Right?\n\nI used to be a customer of yours for years. I love Reno and try to come at least twice a year. The GSR was my happy place.  At least until you practically chased me off. Right into the waiting arms of the Atlantis, which, I have found, is WAY better.  \n\nAnd now your begging me to vote for you as the best? And to do it every day?\n\nIf you want me to think well of you, how about sending me some offers like you used to? I would reconsider if I saw that. If you're \"hoping for my support\" you used to get it but I can't help it if you want to turn your back on me.\n\nBut now all it looks like is you want me to pay through the nose and then call you the best and then vote for you every day?\n\nWOW.\n\nI almost feel like putting this on yelp.com, and probably will feel like it even more if I don't get a response to this, which I doubt if I well.\n\nThank you for \"thinking about me\" this way.   \n\nI wasn't planning on getting a response, and wasn't really planning on putting it on yelp, but then I DID get a response, which really made me want to put it on yelp. It pretty much said this:\n\nThat they would appreciate my vote\nand I can vote every day\nand there are only five days left\nand they are proud (blah blah blah)\nand they look forward to seeing me again\n\nAnd of course totally ignoring my response. Only, basically, \"C'mon and do stuff for us!\" \n\nGSR, why can't we just go back to the old days where you made me some great offers and everyone ended up happy? I'd be glad to consider you again but YOU'RE the people who just apparently won't have it and that's not my fault.\n\nNow I'm considering going and voting for the Atlantis every day just because of your emails. Because they are better.\n\nBut don't blame me for that. It's all your actions that made me learn that.\n\nP.S. Take look at Sophia's response to an earlier review below and compare it to what I've written above. Do you think the Marketing team will see if there is some improvement needed?

All of them were amazing. \n\nStopping into the actual store is like stepping into a Food Network set. Beautiful presentation, cute decor, and retail items for sale. They carry cute sparklers for your cakes, as well as funky candles, and picturesque platters. I ordered two bundlets, a Red Velvet and a Carrot cake. With immaculate frosting and presentation. They were premade but very moist and delicious. You need to check these cakes out!!","stars":4}
{"region":"WEST","text":"I decided to put my faith in this place because it was close my house and I didn't really feel like driving way down south to get a polish change done. In hindsight, I should have. I had to wait 20 minutes before I was taken when I had an appointment, which is fine - I understand salons get busy and I really didn't mind the wait. What I did mine was my nail being burned because the tech decided to file off my existing gel polish and was too impatient to soak it off. Then, her file slipped and took off a quarter of my thumb nail. I maintained my composure and shrugged it off. It didn't stop there - I asked for an almond shape and the tech gave me a Quasimodo shaped, lopsided half almond for a middle finger nail. Finally, the techs switched and the polish was applied by someone else extremely quickly. She clearly had better things to do. Again, I understand that salons get busy and other people are waiting but she didn't even let me finish the full 60 seconds with the UV light. To add insult to injury, I was charged $25 when I was quoted $20. The only reason why I gave two stars is because the receptionist was exceptionally friendly and attentive. It seems like other people had a good experience but probably won't go here again - it's simply not worth it.","stars":2}

He clearly explained the quote and the breakdown of costs, showed me photos of his work, and offered to give me references.

The Mule was well made and came in a Tito's copper mug. A bit smaller than other places, still excellent. Pork belly tacos: those, are a little piece of heaven. Juicy, delicious and everything works perfectly together. Sliders: the short rib meat is well seasoned. The pretzel bun was a tad dry, but...when dipped in the jous on the side, it's amazing.

We have received so many compliments during and after our wedding on our choice of DJ (E-wrek), and we are very happy that we did! We found Gavin Roy Presents via a wedding website, but it turns out that he knew both our wedding coordinator and caterer. Small community! So it was very helpful to have vendors that have worked with each other before. It made myself and my husband feel relaxed that we could hand the reigns over and not worry about it. That's just what we did! I enjoyed hearing all the music that we spent weekends listening and choosing for our wedding day. Looking back I cannot remember all that was played, but I do remember the important ones like the song during our processional and first dance. I remember screaming and jumping to Shout! And I remember the first song opening the dance floor - Shut up and dance with me. I've never seen so many people rush the dance floor before and it was amazing to witness. I truly cannot recommend Gavin and DJ E-wreck enough. It's true that hearing a song can bring back memories, and that's what happens when I hear these songs, which is a gift that will keep on giving.

{"region":"WEST","text":"I really enjoy fried chicken. I love 'em all--KFC, Church's, Albertson's, Fry's, Lucky Wishbone, etc. Popeye's is REALLY good. I enjoy the breading, the sides, everything.\n\nSo far I've had their regular, spicy, and blackened (available only with tenders) chicken. I've also had their shrimp. And the strawberry cheesecake pie. I've had almost all the sides: red beans and rice, slaw, mashed taters with gravy, mac & cheese. I recommend all of it.\n\nI enjoy that crunch when biting into the chicken. It is just right and not too greasy. Flavored deliciously, too. The blackened tenders is different as it does not come breaded but just blackened. When I had it, I missed the breading, but this blackened chicken was flavorful and really good. The shrimp is done in a similar batter. However, the shrimp did not taste shrimpy enough.\n\nYou really gotta have the red beans and rice. Such a good flavor to it. The slaw is really good, not overly sweet, too vinegary, or too creamy. The gravy that goes on the mash potatoes has that Louisiana spice to it and is really good. The mac & cheese is OK, not too bad, but not great. The biscuits are pretty good, better than KFC's and other places. They don't taste like chemicals or  like they're made out of Bisquick. \n\nThe Coca Cola Freestyle dispenser has a lot of Fanta flavors you do not see in stores. One flavor that I kind of questioned was Peach. Yup, peach pop. It is actually good. I have it every time I go there, now.\n\nWhat's great is you fill out an online survey from your receipt, you get a free two piece meal with a side. That's a good deal.\n\n5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.\n4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.\n3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.\n2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.\n1* = How are they still in business?

I gave them the only time I wasn't available. They said Robert would hit my window first. Coincidentally, he should up 10 minutes before the meeting I couldn't reschedule. So I had to take the call while he was here. He put a new drain pump and left without seeing if it was fixed. About three hours later I called back and said the water had not drained. The person answering the phone said she would contact the technician and \"see what he wants to do.\" I did not receive a call back. So the following day I called and asked about what the plan was. They said it was a plumbing issue and they don't do plumbing. I will never recommend or do business with this company again. I had a plumber come out today, a Saturday and laugh saying you can tell it's not a clog just by looking at the lines. Nothing is backed up. Water is going where it should.

They represent the diversity of creatures in the Arizona landscape. We were up in Mt.

You feel like you are at The Karchtner Caverns outside of Benson.  I also enjoyed the mineral exhibits, telling about the rich mining history of Az in regions such as Bisbee and Cochise.\n\nOur favorite part of our visit to the museum had to be the question and answer time with the docent in the ethnobotany area. Her name was Lynn Rigoletta and she was an absolute wealth of information. We chatted with her for a couple of hours. We learned about mesquite pods, harvesting mesquite and making mesquite flour. We also learned about jojoba and how to distinguish the male and female plants. We learned about chiltepin-the mother of all peppers, and about the saguaro and the edible parts of that amazing plant and other cacti. We learned about how the dove is now the main pollinator of the saguaro whereas before it used to be the bat.  \n\nHer knowledge helped open up a whole new world to us. We left the museum on a quest to find mesquite flour, cholla buds, and chiltepin.  We actually randomly ran across chiltepin and mesquite being utilized at Exo coffee roasters. Really cool to see a coffee shop in town utilize regional ingredients in their drinks. \n\nPer Lynn's recommendation we went to Native Seed Search and were able to find and purchase mesquite flour, chiltepin seeds and tepary beans to grow. From Native Seed search we were led to the beautiful San Xavier Mission and their farm co-op store where we purchased cholla buds. \n\nFor the rest of our time in Tucson I was pointing out creosote bushes, jojoba trees, naming off different types of cactus, and we were harvesting mesquite pods to nibble on as we explored Mt. Lemmon and the environs. \n\nIf you want to learn about the Sonoran desert and Arizona head over to the museum and make it a point to stop and talk to the well informed docents. They are the true hidden gems inside the Arizona Sonora Museum.","stars":5}

We ended up with a deluxe room which included a kitchenette, which has everything you need including gas stove\/oven, refrigerator, sink, dishes and pots and pans.  The hotel is small in size but very quaint.  They offer continental breakfast, cheese and cider in the afternoon and cookies and milk in the evening.  It's about a 5 minute walk to the beach, there's a small supermarket on the corner, gas station and liquor store as well.  You can rent bikes and movies as well.  Only downside, is the apartment complex across the parking lot, which is an eye sore.  Other than that.  You will be content with this find.","stars":4}

Go fetch your drink (with crunchy pebble ice!) while you zone out on one of many big screens showing sports (usually with some board sports playing on at least one tv if available, yay!). In just about 10 minutes after paying, your pie comes out of the brick oven with a perfectly crispy\/chewy crust and perfectly proportioned cheese and toppings. Even when this place is popping on a Friday night and the line is long, the wait isn't bad. They've got this production down! The price is a pretty solid deal and for our large family of eight, actually comes out cheaper than most pizza franchises of much lesser quality. Try the Woody, it's my favorite.","stars":5}

We ordered drinks that never came until 30 minutes later when we physically had to go get a waiter\/waitress to bring it. They still forgot some of our drinks even after that and we had to again go get a waiter\/waitress. Took them another 45 minutes for them to finally come and take our food order.

{"region":"WEST","text":"Everything is divine when I stay at a Ritz Carlton; The RC Dove Mountain was no exception on this past getaway where I surprised my husband who couldn't go very far from home due to travel on the front & end of this birthday getaway. The impeccable service started days before we even arrived when I called to have a few little things done for him for his birthday getaway. Christian, answered all my questions with true courtesy & professionalism & had Jaqueline, a concierge call me to set up having a birthday cake sent up on the night we would celebrate my husbands day while we were at dinner. Upon arrival at the Ritz Carlton, you are met at the gate; asked your name so that by the time you arrive at the main area of the hotel where your doors are opened & chilled bottles of waters are handed to you, the staff is ready for you. Valet parking here is a part of your resort fee, albeit, its steep, but there are activities on property that are inclusive of this fee that set this resort apart from the rest. Mainly, it is the service and attention to detail. I booked an Executive Suite, but on check in we were upgraded to a Superior Canyon Suite. Everyone uses your name  from 'go'. Although, a funny little tidbit, two with our name at check in- the clerk gleefully came out with 'anniversary' balloons and said, 'Happy 10 Years! To you both!!' . To which I chuckled, \"NO! It's just his birthday.. we are celebrating only 3 next month in the Caribbean! haha!\". She looked so embarrassed but it was a fun moment & we thought that is gonna be so fun for the true name sake! The bell hop, William, showed us to our room & along the way pointed out little details to the property that we had forgotten about, as its been a few years since we had been here. He gave us hiking\/biking trail maps, (bikes are complimentary too!); took my husbands golf clubs to store at the club house, (also comp'd); pointed out where the flute player would play in about an hour at sunset (we had a direct vantage point to he & the sunset over the canyon which was amazing from our suite!). Once to our room, features of the suite were pointed out by William to us. The suite was appointed so well; with two balconies overlooking the canyon and pools , they made for the perfect place to take in the sunset while enjoying the flute story\/song that takes place at 515p, as well. The bed is one of the comfiest ever & the linens are sumptuous. There were  1.5 bathrooms in this room with the larger having a huge soaking tub. Mini refrigerators have replaced mini bars & there is a Nespresso machine with real espresso cups; small things matter! The cake I ordered prior to arrival was delivered when we were celebrating his birthday dinner at Cayton's Burger Bistro, one of four on site dining options. They even sent balloons , candles, plates & a Happy Birthday note! The pools here are beautiful especially at night when fire pits are lit around all of them. Larger fire pits are at the lobby bar\/restaurant, Ignite and so pretty for enjoying the peacefulness the RC offers. The only change I would make is offering cabanas away from the kids section of pool. We did not get a cabana this visit mainly due to that we didn't like how 'busy' it was near the kids pool area; although we did find the cabanas here to be pretty sweet! Brunch is $33 for full American at Core , which is steep but again, you get a beautiful place & impeccable service; our waitress treated my husband to a birthday Biscuit\/Chorizo\/Gravy stack ! The on site 'Rangers' showed us the desert creatures including the desert tortoise & various snakes! Eek! But also great for kids! The Ritz Carlton is full of beauty and on point with service that goes well above and beyond other luxury resorts; this is truly one of our favorites!","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"Here is a list of what we found wrong at our recent stay:\n1) Check in supposed to be at 4, we arrive at 5:30 Room not ready.\n2) In-room dining has to be done on a phone using their software which I'd\n    characterize as non-optimal.  Very limited choice.  Food is brought in bags with no portable table. Some of the servers didn't have masks. Worst in-door dining I've seen in 20 years of using this.\n3) Room cleaners left clearly uneaten food on plates.\n4) Toilet was loose and would \"rock\" when you sit down (see pic of loose bolt-nut). This borders on being a safety hazard.\n5) Bathroom roof tiles dirty with what looks like mold(see pic)\n\nFor a 4 star hotel, I'd expect better then this. We paid premium dough for substandard service.  Note that the Hilton Chain really provides no easy way to provide feedback.  Poor management from top to bottom.  Won't go back!","stars":1}

All they had left were smoking rooms, and even then it was amazing. The beds were so comfortable, there was a nice big TV in the room, as well as in the bathroom. The bathroom had an air jacuzzi tub that self-cleans, and also a shower with two nice shower heads. All the lighting is adjustable so you can dim it to any level of brightness you want. The customer service is great. I had a delivery waiting for me, and they delivered it up to my room within minutes of getting up there. I had a room on the 16th floor facing the pool, which was very beautiful, especially at night. I got the room for my birthday weekend, and it was just really comfortable :) \n\nI went to the Spa Tuscana the next morning, and had a \"wine down massage\" and a \"vino facial\" (I believe those are the names of what I got). The spa is really nice and totally comforting. They have a lounge area for when you are waiting for your next treatment, with complementary snacks and water\/juice. It seems like a really large spa, with an elevator to get to the different levels. You get a robe and shoes, and a locker to keep your things in. Each room that I had my treatments done in were very clean, and relaxing. The treatments themselves were amazing, and the employees were very nice and professional. Definitely a place to go if you want to really indulge yourself in the pleasures they offer. It is expensive, but totally worth it every once in a while.","stars":5}

We arrived early, so we could enjoy happy hour, and were promptly seated...right around the corner from where the live music was going to be. ugh.\nTurns out, it was just one guy on a guitar, playing nice soft music. Not bad! Enjoyable, and grandpa could still hear us!\nOur waiter was double sat, and seemed to be very grumpy. I'll give him that for a bit, I know its a pain to get double sat. However, we were a slow table. We wanted to take advantage of the happy hour before we actually ordered dinner. As soon as the waiter realized we were going to be there a while, and were ordering lots of drinks and appetizers (aka, spending more money that I guessed we looked like we were going to) he perked up. He became super friendly, big smile, joking. Maybe he just came on shift and finally got his coffee. Who knows. It was just weird to have such grumpy service that turned into fun service. \nWe had some happy hour specialty drinks (each one is basically a variance on an Long Island). One of mine came out tasting like straight tequila. I'm a big girl, and like my liquor, but my fiance saved me from multiple shots, and had the waiter fix it up. Our server shined here, he actually took our drink back, had them make a new one, and brought me an extra as well!\nWe ordered the calamari appetizer. Typical, yum.\nI had the stuffed fish. Turns out it wasn't really stuffed, just a mix of shrimp and crab meat stuffed between two pieces of white fish. Nothing fancy. Thank goodness there was a hollandaise type sauce on it all, as the white fish itself was meh. \nI also had the lobster bisque...yum!\nGrandpa had the steak, he was super pleased. super juicy, moist, cooked to perfection.\nFiance had the lobster tacos.

{"region":"WEST","text":"I had the wonderful pleasure of dining at this great steakhouse last night and every moment of it was simply amazing!\nEverything about it exceeded my expectations: the food, the ambiance, the service. It was all absolutely spectacular.\nI love that at this restaurant they are still dedicated to doing a lot of table presentations, I think it gives them a very unique edge over pretty much every other restaurant I have ever been to. This was definitely one of the best and most memorable meals I have ever had and I would absolutely come back again, in fact I am already trying to plan a trip back now...\nTo start, they have some of the best wait staff around. They all wear nice, clean tuxedos and yet somehow they still manage to not catch on fire when doing over-the-top presentations. The table next to ours ordered the \"El Diablo\" which is like a flaming coffee drink and I was simply shocked to see that the waiter, Ozzie, did not even need to roll up his sleeves before he started \"firing up\". I mean he was literally pouring flames into tiny little espresso cups and his tux remained spotless (and singe-less, LoL)!! Truly an amazing feat in my opinion.\nI was also amazed when our waiter began preparing our caesar salad, he didn't even need an apron and yet there was not a speck on his crisp white shirt when he was done. How do they do it!?\nThis freshly prepared caesar salad was seriously The. Best. Ever. And I have had a lot of caesar salads over the years, but this was just salad perfection. The freshly crushed garlic and anchovies mixed with the egg yolk which is then hand whipped right in front of you with olive oil, a little Worcester and red wine vinegar just absolutely melts in your mouth. I was in heaven with each bite. Simply delicious. \nI also love that before you get your main dish, they serve you a wonderful little palate cleansing sorbet. I have never been to restaurant that does this so it was truly one of those things that just made this place truly extraordinary and memorable. It was perfect following the salad too because the garlic and anchovies certainly will stay with you otherwise and even though it was nice still savoring the flavors, I'm sure it was best to start my meal with a nice, clean palate.\nI ordered the steak and lobster which were simply wonderful. The steak was cooked perfectly, tender and moist, the lobster was already taken off the shell and all I had to do was enjoy. I love when all the work is done for you!  \nFor dessert we ordered the bananas foster which was another great table side presentation, anything with flames is always a plus. They also give you a cute little tray filled with truffles and mint chocolates at the end of your meal that is bubbling with dry ice. Very cool effect to see the clouds of air flow all over your table and such an amazing extra treat! \nEverything was absolutely better than I could have imagined and I can't wait to come back again some day. I really can't say enough good things about this restaurant, it's simply out of this world.\nI highly recommend The Steakhouse at Harrah's, it is a MUST if you are in Reno!","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"I am giving 5 stars based on the service. The facility was nice, typical JW, situated in a semi remote area of town in West Tucson at the foot of the mountains. It is the service that pushed it up to 5 star. Here are a couple of highlights:\n* the fantastic service was started at check in when we were not only allowed early check in (at 10am) but upgraded to a lovely room with a full parlour with a perfect view overlooking the city. It was such a nice touch. Now, do I need separate bathrooms, two balconies, and a dining table seating 8 when traveling? No, but I enjoyed it.\n* They have a main pool and a separate nice lazy river which we went around a couple of times. Service at the main pool was very friendly and efficient. We asked our server (wish we would have caught his name) at the pool about nearby shopping. He asked what we were looking for and then came back with a very detailed hand written map and directions, thought that was a nice touch. We didn't eat, but the cocktails were sure nice.  During our trips around the lazy river, there was a semi rowdy group in front of us who were ordering their cocktails from their tubes around the lazy river and would pick up their drinks on the next go-around. We didn't try that, but it didn't look like a bad way to spend the day!\n* they have a tequila toast (with story of it's origin) every evening at 5:30 offering a shot of different tequila daily. Now I am not a tequila person, but these were flavored tequilas that were infused on site at the tequila bar, Salud. Salud is a comfortable tequila bar with big comfy chairs\/sofas surrounding fire pits overlooking the pool with the lights of Tucson off in the distance. Such a comfortable place to relax after a day at the pool or hiking.  The first night the tequila shot was a strawberry infused tequila, it was smooth like I have never found tequila to be. The Restaurant Manager, Jorge, was awesome, stopping by our table and telling us about the process and selection. He mentioned a cucumber tequila which I expressed interest in. The next day, the tequila toast wasn't cucumber tequila, but he remembered us and brought me out an additional shot so I could try it. Man, was it good. I ordered a specialty margarita using the tequila (the Sonoran Heat, it was awesome), Jorge thought it took to long to get to us (it really didn't, service was very good) so he comped them. So for people keeping score, that was the complimentary shots for my husband and I, plus an extra complimentary shot because we were interested in different flavor, plus two complimentary cocktails because we waited a couple of minutes. Not too shabby. In addition, he remembered us every time he saw us walking around, was always very friendly, helpful, and informative.\n\nI will go back to this hotel just to see Jorge (and drink the specialty margaritas of course).","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"I'm becoming quite fond of this little cozy alcove on the south side of Congress.  I believe it's way ahead of its time (or place perhaps) as a boozy breakfast cereal-y place with luscious melted cheese sandwiches, home made chips and...doughnuts -- say what?  \nI just can't put it in a box, and that keeps me interested -- in my adoring confusion.\nThe service is kind, efficient, thoughtful, afore-thoughful, and friendly.  The food comes out timely and it's quite simply the best cheese and bread combo and freshness I've had in a comfort food sandwich.\nThe menu on the board can be a wondrous bewilderment, but the server often greets with an old-fashioned in-hand menu.  I have yet to try any alcoholic cereals (are they putting one on me?) as I am a lunch-break go-er, and it may have an overly subdued location and streetfront presence to create a passers-by allure -- they are just a block too far from all the lawyers in town and a couple blocks too far from all the students -- so I really hope they last and succeed.  They don't have gluten free options to all their bready delights, which may also hinder some dietary minded fat craving seekers.\nThere's something wildly creative at this place and I hope they're not too ahead of their time.  I remain intrigued.","stars":4}

{"region":"WEST","text":"We signed up to do a margarita crawl several weeks ago in Indianapolis. We were excited about this and watched as updates were made to the site. Unfortunately we already spent $60 on our tickets and after a few weeks found that we were going to have house guests at the time of the crawl. Knowing we did not want to eat our tickets, we purchased 2 more tickets for our guests as we didn't want to leave them at our house while we were downtown having fun doing this crawl. Unfortunately we found as the site updated it was not a crawl at all. It was nothing more than a list of local venues with drink specials. The day of the event the site continued to update. We found that the registration site venue offered their usual drink specials for the weekend, however, we were able to bring back our receipt from them for entry to their after party event. It was very clear in the initial site posting that only 100 people would get the swag bags, so I have no complaints there as we had no intention get downtown at 2 pm with Gen Con and our state fair going on at the same time. Our 2nd venue didn't even offer margarita specials. We had Jell-O shots here which was the special. Onto venue 3. This venue was packed!  We opted to go into this as dining guests and took a seat in the dining room. We ate here, got our margarita at the discounted price. Venue 4 was all around horrible.  The wait staff was angry with all the crawlers coming in for the listed specials. The staff was loud about their frustrations.  We asked for the margarita special and asked about the $2 taco specials only to be rudely told they were out of tacos and they had no salt for margarita rims. While at this venue, the site updated again. We found that one of the listed venues on the crawl was not opening until 7:00 pm, the crawl was set to end at 8:00pm. We wrote this venue off all together. ANOTHER UPDATE to the site came in adding another venue late in the crawl, we opted to go to this venue. We were so happily surprised to find this venue treating the margarita crawl as an actual crawl. We were not charged a penny for the margaritas. We were so shocked after spending a couple of hundred dollars in addition to the $120 in tickets elsewhere, we stayed here, drank margaritas, ate again and had a great time people watching. Our waitress was polite and helpful. We will totally spend our money back at this venue and not look back at any of the others we visited. In the past every crawl we have ever been involved in you purchased your ticket, got your wrist band and had a limit of 2 margaritas per venue. I have never done a crawl where you pay for a ticket and then pay for your drinks as well. I am so extremely disappointed and will never do a crawl in Indianapolis again which is a shame as we have an amazing city but after yesterday - realizing how many horrible venues we have within it.","stars":1}

{"region":"WEST","text":"Bottom Line: Four stars for the staff here for staying calm and carrying on in the face of some real jerks.  \n\n\n\nThe people that buy food here are terrible to the staff.  Cut these people some slack already - they are busting their backs to get you your precious orange chicken, ok?  Calm your pits, Karen.\n\nTerrible.\n\nI have been in this location many times and a review is well overdue.  I have overheard patrons yelling at the staff but today was worse than usual.\n\nThe way that people off of the street talk to the employees here is horrendous.  Just because it's a fast-food style place, doesn't give anyone the right to be a jerk.   Today a lady in a power suit went full on Karen mode saying inappropriate things (in a snarling and very nasal tone) \"IM CALLING YOUR MANAGER\".  My favorite part is that she left with her food and walked over to Chicken Ranch and used their tables to eat lunch!\n\nThat's real class.  \n\nSo you didn't get as much food as you wanted, why not yell in an accusatory way until you've embarrassed the employee to the point where they don't have a choice.\n\nOR - maybe - just maybe - try being kind and discuss your concerns like a regular person.  Chances are, they will make it right.  \n\nTHEY ARE ALSO PEOPLE, JUST LIKE YOU.\n\nDont like it?  Take it up with corporate as THOSE people are the ones that hand down all of the marching orders.\n\nDo you really think the people behind the counter getting minimum wage have a say in portion distribution??  They work for a huge company and they are doing what they have been trained to do because they don't want to get fired.\n\nToday I had to kneel down and explain to my son that this is not the way we talk to or treat people - especially within the service industry.  I asked the staff if people were always that rude and they said \"We are used to it\".\n\nThat's horrifying - nobody should have to ever feel as if they should get used to people being that rude.\n\nWhy does my family keep coming back here again and again?  Partially because we are lazy and don't want to make dinner every night BUT ALSO because the food is exactly what you think it's going to be.  Its consistently good!  Do they make mistakes?  Of course they do!  I'll ya'll in on a little secret right now..... people makes mistakes NO MATTER where you are or what you're doing.\n\nThats life.  If you cant live with that, start your own town and tell me how that goes.  Im sure it'll be perfect.\n\nI have worked in service based jobs for much of my life and still do.  Frankly, had someone spoken to me like that, they might have found themselves outside the building.\n\nI hope that all the folks working here get a nice big fat raise for having to put up with the public at large...because nobody deserves to be treated like this.\n\nHang tough, Goleta Panda employees!","stars":4}

Saw lots of 20-somethings and in particular, bridal parties down there (at least one tiara or sash wearing bride-to-be at every wine tasting room) which was somewhat expected (our kids are in their 20s). We went for some wine tasting and to walk around. I think the most impressive aspect of this place is how the city is turning an old warehouse district into something trendy rather than raze the area and build anew (with the exception of a few buildings (large hotel in particular). Just for the record, my gf and I are not fans of Westwood or a lot of nooky neighborhoods designed for walking around to just eat and shop. Is Santa Barbara getting so built up that it needs a carved out getaway neighborhood just as LA near UCLA needs a Westwood? \n\nWe enjoyed about 1\/3 the wine tasting rooms we visited (avoid Pali - the most expensive with the smallest pours and most disinterested and uninformed tasting bar staff - Municipal was better than expected although - meh+ quality but near to beach and other tasting rooms. Our favorite was LaFond that had the most informed staff, a winemaker with a vision and a good value for the tasting.) Went to Lucky Penny for a quick bite - good. If we go again we will try Lark. I was there years ago prior to the Zone being created. It was good. \n\nLow points are parking. 90-minute limits all around kept us moving our car between jaunts around the zone. Shopping also meh. Very overpriced boutique shops and kitschy knick-knack stores. Not sure how any of the 20-somethings around there could buy any of it. Overall, the place makes for a nice walk and OK eat & drink.

My husband and I walked up to the hostess desk upon arrival asking for a table outside since it was freezing cold inside. The hostesses (yes, there were two of them) gave us the blankest, rudest stares and then proceeded to say that we could seat ourselves wherever we wanted. We took the menus and went to a seat outside, which the hostesses were only kind enough to point out the way to after we stood there a little confused for a second.\n\nWe were seated outside (on a slightly dirty table) waiting for quite a long time before anyone came to see us even though we were not the only ones outside. We finally were asked our drink orders and proceeded with our evening. When our appetizers were brought out, which was by someone other than the server taking our order (whom we barely saw at all), they were given to the wrong table. Honest mistake, no biggie. Except it happened again with both of our meals, which were not even brought out complete (I had to remind them about a side dish they'd forgotten to bring out). This was a little frustrating because it had taken so long to get the food in the first place. The food was also all cold, which might have been due to the fact that we couldn't even start eating when we got our food because we had not been given any silverware. \n\nOverall, the service was just horrible. While we were outside we noticed that another couple was seated by the hostess; I guess they were customers of higher importance than us. The server didn't even introduce herself to us; she more or less just rushed in and out getting the little bit of information she needed to take our orders. The food was good but not great, and it definitely was not worth the horrible attitudes and service we encountered. I did not feel like we were respected or treated well at all. I definitely would not recommend this location to anyone at all. I might try the other location to see how it compares.","stars":1}

As is typical, the FB event listing said it started at 5pm but that was when the cart showed up, not when food was available.  We ordered the Texan quesadilla ($10), Tuscan hotdog, El Elotero hotdog, and the Shanghai hotdog to try. The Chipotle lime drizzle on the quesadilla is amazing. The quesadilla \"container\" really needs to be something other than just foil, since the cheese glues the quartered quesadilla to the foil. Maybe some parchment paper liner? Anyways, the hotdogs ($6 each) were pretty awesome. Would be nice to have warm corn and maybe some sort of binder so that the corn doesn't fall out all over the place, off the El Elotero. Flat bread options were not on the menu.","stars":4}

I think the last time I came in was just a fluke, so I am going to give them a solid 4 stars... When I last came it was only their 2nd week of opening and I did come in at late night.. and it WAS news years.... so maybe I was a bit harsh... Tacos weren't so small this second time around, and they were all stuffed substantially well. The big thing though that Gio really has going for them is their drinks on tap... Holy cow their version of punch is good!!! and on tap too!! How awesome is that??\nThe only true thing that kinda gets in the way of giving them 5 stars all around is still their price. I just cannot justify paying 18.00 for 5 tacos and still risk being hungry after that. Maybe its just me, but I would rather go somewhere else with that type of money to get a full sit down meal.. \n\nOh p.s if you like horchata.. you will really enjoy Gio's version of churros!\nCoffee here is great as well!","stars":4}

I also liked how bright and clean the store was. Something about that just made you feel happy while shopping. Things like that absolutely affect your mood while shopping and kind of makes you want to buy more! I was also impressed by their seafood section, which looked delectable and was affordable! \nSomething I was surprised about was that the vegan section was a little smaller than I would expect from a store like Sprouts. It was a little all over the place too, and not clearly labeled. I was trying a vegan diet for a few days, and ended up having to go to another grocery store just to complete my shopping list. \nThe younger man who checked us out was super friendly, and easy to talk to. He even gave me some tip on switching to a vegan diet, as he was doing the same. \nI will also add, because my boyfriend rarely reviews anything, that he said he will be buying all of his meat from Sprouts now because of the pricing and quality.","stars":4}

I also purchased some pecan spiced honey butter, and I haven't tried it yet, but oh man! I can hardly wait!  My mom loved her pecan brittle,  and dad liked his cinnamon pecans.  Are you seeing the variety yet? They also had samples of pecan tea (good, but needed sugar\/sweet and low and more ice) and prickly pear tea (not so good - I don't think sugar would fix it, even the kid working there said he didn't like it).  If they had k - cups of the pecan coffee, the hubby would have been sold on it!  He had some in Texas the day before and said it was great!  My only complaint or suggestion is the same as a previous reviewer- friendlier staff.  How about a hello when you walk in? An offer to help you find something?  An explanation of what they have? Anything?  When we were purchasing he was finally talking to us and we then discovered a discount for locals (dad) and saved 10%, paying for my pecan spiced honey butter!   Score!

MOTEL NOT IN BUSINESS BUT WILL TAKE RESERVATIONS, CARD\/INFO, AND SEND CONFIRMATION EMAIL ANYWAY!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI had stayed here once before a year ago when I was in a last minute pinch. Honestly, I did not have issues with it. Sure it was a bit gross and rundown, but I was only looking for a place to crash for the night. \n\nHowever, when my boyfriend and I decided to have a little two day vacation in SB, we opted to stay cheap and I booked this place again online. The website DOES NOT say they are no longer open or taking reservations. I input my credit card number and all of my information which I am now awfully upset that I did. \n\nWhen we arrived, the parking lot in front was blocked off, half was under construction, there were washers\/dryers, couches, etc. strewn about the parking lot, and the windows were all boarded up. My boyfriend went to see if anyone was on site after numerous failed calls to the number on their website. (All I got was, \"all signals are busy.\") NO ONE, not a soul, was there and the place looked creepy and abandoned. Obviously they had to shut down halfway through construction and decided not to tell anyone. \n\nWe were lucky enough to get a room for only $20 more at a motel nearby. Thank god! It was right next to the beach and looked like everything had just been updated. When we explained to the man at the front desk there what we had just been through, he told us of the man that owns the joint and asked us to google him when we got the chance. Apparently he is a notorious crook around town. This worries me greatly! All of my information is now in the hands of a criminal who takes \"reservations\" for a motel that no longer exists. \n\nI called my bank to make sure there was no charge and there hasn't been yet. They are on alert but I'm still nervous that he could run up my credit from any which way now if he really is who he's made out to be.

However, if you receive horrible service and tip the server to reflect that service, expect a scene outside the restaurant. That's exactly what happen to me tonight. Jess, as a matter of fact was that server and Tony the manager is the one who cared less about it. Jess was friendly but forgot many things like napkins and did not returned to the table until yelled at by name. Which I find sad because you are 10 feet away. The 2 people I attendend lunch with are all servers and agreed to tip her 4 dollars out of 43 to reflect on our treatment. What happened next blew me away! Jess followed out side and demanded a higher tip. Now if I had given that service at my work which is btw a very well known sports bar, my manager would have said tough luck!

{"region":"WEST","text":"Wow, this place has come a long way!  I used to work at the same location in it's former life as Abdi's.  Adbi's was great, but totally different.  This place is cool, almost too cool for Santa Barbara.  It has a great outdoor fireplace, as well as amazing art, good music and awesome lighting such as uplight walls.  The combination creates an awesome, sultry vibe virtually unmatched anywhere else in SB..  \n\nI met some friends here pre-New Years celebrations yesterday.  After having driven by numerous times, I was excited to have finally made it inside (again.)  I ordered a Coconut Mojito (thanks to reviews of my fellow yelpers) and my Dad got the Pisco Sour.  They said that this was made from a wine stem liquor, 7 egg whites and some other stuff.  While my coconut mojito was the best damn mojito (perhaps the best drink) I've ever had, the Pisco Sour was probably the worst.  I don't tend to like strong drinks, and this was really strong, so who knows, someone else may like it.\n\nAnyway, we ended up sharing a couple tapas:  the Paellita ($15 and superb,) the Date with A Pig ($9, delicious but the tiniest thing I've ever seen,) the Proscuitto Wrap ($9, and also super tiny - don't even bother getting it, it's a waste of money,) and a couple other things.  I thought the food was great, but like other yelpers, found that many of the serving sizes were crazy small.  The Paellita was the only thing that was well proportioned and would feed an adult for dinner.  Otherwise, don't plan on doing dinner here unless you are ready to spend a wallet full of money on numerous tiny (but delicious) tapas.  \n\nRegardless of the small portions, I'm still obligated to give this place 4 stars:\n\n+ 1 star: The atmosphere is superb, the music was awesome - it put me in a great mood.\n+2 stars:  The food was awesome, though small, it was great!\n+3 stars:  The service was awesome.  All our servers were super nice, hip and very helpful.  Thank you.\n+4 stars:  The drinks were awesome.  Normally you get one or the other, good food or good drinks.

{"region":"WEST","text":"I can only say positive things about Karen D Photography. To begin, even prior to the wedding, Karen was always so kind, helpful, & friendly. I'm not local to the Santa Barbara area and I was looking around for photographers, vendors, & venues for my wedding. Unlike any other photographer I spoke to, Karen was the ONLY one who sent me a long list of recommendations for vendors & venues. That list, support, & caring character helped me during such a stressful time. Throughout the process, through the ups & downs of the pandemic & closures, Karen was there for me. That is well beyond her role as a wedding photographer but it shows her one of a kind character. I knew from the start, I wanted her to be our wedding photographer! Another thing I love is that she tags the vendors her couples use for their weddings. It totally helped me find local resources to use. Karen's attention to detail, her kindness, & her photography skills are unmatched! On the day of my wedding, she was flawless. She made me feel so comfortable, helped me get perfect photos throughout the day, but especially at the Santa Barbara Courthouse and Convivo Restaurant. Even prior, she had me develop a list to determine important photos I wanted, it gave me time to actually think about it because wedding days are usually hectic. She also provided a second photographer to help capture our day. I feel we were able to get great photos throughout the SB Courthouse grounds because Karen knows the location, she knows where the lighting is best, & knows all the angles. For our reception at Convivo restaurant, she took more photos there to allow for additional variety. I will cherish my wedding day & all my photographs for my lifetime. Karen took pictures of all the details which was so fun to relive when my completed wedding profile was sent over. I love that I have photos of such special moments with my parents, grandparents, & family. My family also loved her! Karen provided us all our wedding photos quickly, before the expected timeframe & they are all phenomenal! I'll include some for reference. Thank you so much Karen. We are so appreciative of you & your hard work!","stars":5}

The lights on the wall look exactly like the leg lamp in \"A Christmas Story\"! Lol. \n\nShe sits us right at the exit- so every person coming and going was passing our table! Akward. Almost immediately a very sweet girl, Ashley came to bring us water. Our waitress, Vaida- took our drink order. Vaida returns10 minutes later and she's opening a bottle of wine and she's just going on and on about salad dressing and totally oblivious to the fact that I'm trying to interject to tell her I did NOT order a bottle. She stops talking long enough (after she opened it) for me to tell her that I asked for a glass, and she's like, \"Well I can cork it and you can take the rest home\". Um, no thank you? I'm really not interested in paying $50 for a bottle of something I have at home and just want ONE glass of. \n\nWell, either that pissed her off or something happened to her that put her in a foul mood because we sat there with our menus for another 15 minutes. I had to flag down another waiter to get her so we could order. My boyfriend ordered the Lobster and Filet Mignon (medium well), and it came with a salad ($80)  I ordered the Prime Rib-medium rare (bone in) and the yukon smashed potatoes and a salad. ($38) From what I can recall, on the menu, where I found my selection made no indication about the prime rib- other than the choice for bone in or not. My boyfriend said he loved the Herb Vinagerette on his salad. \n\nWe waited 40 min for our food. Our waitress came by once during that time (after she saw how annoyed we looked) to offer us more bread (which we had devoured because we were starving) We were seriously pissed off at this point, and to make matters worse- it was hot as balls in there. I was literally sweating down my back and my legs were all sticky and sliding in the vinyl booth. Ugh. I had to wave her over and ask her to have them turn the air up. I couldn't enjoy my wine because it was so damn hot in there, and drinking would just make me warmer. \n\nOur food arrives and Ryans steak is charred, over-cooked and looked NASTY and dry. It was way past well done. He took one bite. To their credit, he did say the Lobster was the best he'd ever had and that it just melted in his mouth (even tho there was pieces of shell or bone in it). My prime rib- OH MY GOD. They brought me a baby cow. For real. I posted a picture of the monster piece of meat they brought me. It was at least 2 inches thick and about 7x9 (they should warn you!)and cooked to perfection. I didn't even need the Au jus. The potatoes were 'meh'- they needed salt- they tasted like plain, boring potatoes. They had draped asparagus over my potatoes without any hint that it would be there. I hate that. So my potatoes had a green, watery, asparagus-y film over them. Bleh. \n\nBecause of where we were sitting, every single person that walked by made a comment about the food on my plate. The manager noticed that Ryan hadn't eaten his steak and asked if it was okay. He pointed out that it was over-cooked and even though we didn't ask and tried to refuse, the manager insisted they would re-make it. The steak they brought back was a beautifully cooked filet. We ordered the Bananas Foster and unlike Bimini's they did NOT charge us $50 friggin' dollars. I think it was $12 and Jon the flambe cook was very nice.\n\nI know in places like Applebees they will sing and otherwise embarass you if it's your birthday. I did not expect this in a 'fine dining' establishment. I was mortified. The more I blushed and tried to hide, the louder they sang. The neopolatin gelato with fresh berries (and Happy Birthday written in chocolate) they gave me, was beautiful and yummy. Had we known they do that we wouldn't have ordered a dessert. On the way out they give you warm lemon towels and a sour cream crumble breakfast bar that's pretty good. \n\nWe'll be back, I'm sure. Ryan is going to want that dressing & lobster again. Was it worth $190? Not really. To the mgmt there, Ashley saved you. I'll ask for her specifically next time. And turn up the AC dammit! It's HOT in there","stars":3}

Funky location, but great decor and terrific staff. This is a tough one though because the place has a lot going for it, but I had an equal number of complaints, so here it is...\n\nVery nice margaritas, great tequila selection and the bar tender was on his game. We sat down to eat, and got the chips and salsa. Great salsa. Chips from a bag? Uh... Huh? Um....What? \n\nRound two, we figure we'll have an appetizer.. One problem.... THEY DON\"T SERVE APPETIZERS!!!! How is this possible???? Are you kidding me?\n\nSo, now the waiter reads the menu. We both choose to have the chefs special of the night.  Interestingly enough, we both ordered the same thing and got two completely different meals.... Huh? weird but ok... (we wound up trading plates as I liked the look of his plate better)\n\nSo I guess a signature of the place is really fresh ingredients, particularly vegetables. Great, however, it came in the form of a giant salad in the middle of the entree. \n\nLet me just say, this woman can cook big time. Clearly, she is a very talented chef. I liked everything on my plate. However, I question the strategy of this place. Great flavors sort of mixed all up by a plate loaded with food in a very disorganized way.... Just plain over done.... Presentation was a mess.... I had this great green corn tamale pie that I had to dig through a half pound of lettuce to eat.... Great braised beef.... Again, digging though my salad to find it like an easter egg hunt....\nGreat sauces, great flavors... way over complicated....\n\nMust say though, I liked everything on my plate, just wish:\n\nA.

{"region":"WEST","text":"I have never, in the history of yelp, given a 5 star rating - and there isn't any place more deserving then China King. What's funny is that isn't an expensive place to eat; it isn't a fancy place to eat. It's a bit of an awkward place to eat at - very open. They add some nice touches, like linen napkins and tablecloths (which I rarely find at places). \n\nHowever, the food is great. The black peppered chicken is delicious. Orange chicken is awesome. The Sweet Sour Soup + Egg Drop soups are tasty. The food tastes fresh.\n\nI've had the Kung Pow Chicken and Mongolian Beef. I'm generally not a fan of Kung Pow Chicken, but I was feeling like something spicy and that was my meal tonight. It was okay. \n\nThe Mongolian beef is good as well, but so far the black peppered chicken and orange chicken are my favorites. \n\nThe fried rice they have is amazingly good. It has (what I think) is pork, and eggs ... so I guess you could call it a Pork and Eggs fried rice. Either way, it is great.\n\nThe service ... absolutely accommodating. Don't like noodles? Ask for double fried rice. Don't want a specific vegetable cooked with your meal? Not a problem - The food is cooked when you order it and they mix everything together when they cook it. The only time I can remember service that was this accommodating, or went out of their way was at an expensive steakhouse (and it's probably because they had to) - but the waitress here definitely seems to genuinely care about the customers and tries to make each dining experience a pleasurable one.\n\nBottom line: Good, fresh, cheap, fast, friendly. You must go. Don't think - just do it.","stars":5}

This is the only place in Santa Barbara that serves deep dish pizza. I order to-go never dissatisfied- personally love their pesto, salsiccia and funghi. \n\nThere are definitely ways to eat VEGAN here. They have dairy free cheese and so many veggies but personally, I find the sauces so tasty, they really don't need cheese. Order a side of sauce with your pizza and it will come out hot and be steaming with flavor. a small deep dish pizza and salad are great for two people. Cool casual ambiance with outdoor seating.

The waitress seemed very friendly at first until I asked her if she could please check to see if the lemon vinegarrette was dairy free for the salad that I ordered. I have some food allergies but I was really trying to not be a pain. I simply said if you find out if it has dairy please just bring me oil and vinegar, no biggie. She seemed really put out when I asked this of her. I requested no cheese and no pita in the salad. It came with no cheese but with pita (which I just picked out because I could not get her attention... even though she walked past us at least 10 times she would stare straight ahead). I had also ordered a side of savory tots. They didn't come with the meal so halfway thru I had to say \"excuse me\" twice a little loud because she ran past us again. She swung around and when I asked if the tots were on the way still she looked bewildered but said \"yes!\" and ran away again. Over ten more minutes went by, no tots. We were both done eating. She had swung by and refilled the empty Arnold palmer glass with water. We didn't say anything still... then she brought the check. I said to her \"when the tots come out please just box them up to go?\" She looked bewildered again and said \"ok!\" and ran off. I looked at the bill and yep-no tots on there. She came by to get the card from me and I just said, \"the tots aren't on there so please just don't bother\". She said, \"ok.\" Then came back a minute later to say \"they're on their way anyway!\" with a smile. So we smiled and tanked her and waited. And waited. Almost almost ten more minutes... the tots arrived in a to go box. We left quickly. Thank you for the free tots that we waited over 25 minutes for... she obviously forgot to include them not one but twice then just gave them to me.

The menu is simple.\n\nI opted to challenge myself to eating an entire order of delicacy dumplings and fried chicken. 15 dumplings and 5 chicken wings to-go. (approximate count. I think I got extra dumplings?) Service was wishywashy, a little off-track, forgot to say my total, but it got through. Dumplings didn't take long to steam but the chicken made it a 15 minute wait. If you're a condiment junkie, ASK FOR CHILI OIL. They'll just put dumpling sauce in the to-go bag otherwise. Sadly they kinda skimp on the sauce portions, so ask for extra or just keep your dumpling necessities at home. \n\nVerdict? Good dumplings. As someone else had said, the wrapper is doughy, like the store-bought, but otherwise still fills a craving. Not the best dumplings I've had, but I was well-fed and honestly I'd prefer just taking home food from here than purchasing frozen dumplings at any local Asian market as those are expensive and usually not my favorite quality. (Trust me on this one, I've been an As-Am in SB for almost a decade and have had my fair share). The chicken wings I could probably pass on.

{"region":"WEST","text":"I had posted a review of this restaurant on Opentable, and sent a private message to the restaurant via Opentable regarding a part of our dinner experience I felt they should know about.  I never heard back from the restaurant and when I just checked Opentable, my review isn't posted there.  So, I'll give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt that the review didn't go through the Opentable system... and I'll post a review here.\n\nI booked a table at the Stonehouse Restaurant for my husband's birthday dinner during a week long vacation in Santa Barbara.  The Yelp reviews along with a recommendation from my step-mother prompted us to choose this place. \n\nYes, the property itself is beautiful.  I wished we'd stayed there.  Our dinner experience, however, was not as exceptional.  When we checked into the Stonehouse, we were told we had a patio table but were then taken back downstairs to the patio at Plow and Angel.  We never stepped foot into the Stonehouse Restaurant or saw it's beautiful patio off the dining room until we left after dinner.  However, it didn't take us long to catch on that we weren't really experiencing the \"Stonehouse\" dining experience.  Our waiter, a nice enough guy, looked thoroughly confused when he walked up to our table and saw the Stonehouse menus.  He stared at us for a good 5 seconds before asking if we wanted a drink... baffling.  Never asked us if we wanted bottled water.  The waiter behind us, however, was conversing with a table and describing the \"drink of the night\" which was some rum concoction.  When our waiter returned, we asked about this special drink and he was again a little baffled and said he'd forgotten to tell us about it.  We ordered one, just for the sake of it at that point, but then we realized it was the Plow and Angel \"drink of the night.\"  \n\nWhile the patio we sat at was lovely, everyone there was eating off the Plow & Angel menu.  We could have saved ourselves a TON of money if we'd gone that route.  At $375 for two, we had a nice but somewhat confused server who didn't seem altogether familiar with the Stonehouse menu.  The food was very good, and the bottle of wine we ordered was excellent.   \n\nShould I have been more specific when I booked my table, and asked to actually sit in the Stonehouse restaurant\/patio?   The website describes \"Weather permitting, guests can dine under the romantic gaze of Southern California's stars on the ocean view deck--a wood-burning fireplace and heated stone flooring provide year-round comfort..\"  Our table was next to a stone wall (certainly no ocean view in sight) and we enjoyed the frequent sounds of scuffling wildlife in the foliage on the other side of the wall.  My recommendation to the restaurant - maybe get a few cats.  \n\nIf it was on someone else's tab, I would definitely frequent this restaurant again.  And I would make triply sure I was seated in the restaurant I'd reserved.  With an ocean view.  And heated stone flooring.  Sounds wonderful.","stars":3}

She sang to my daughter while explaining how she will count her teeth on the baby she brought in. She had her put gloves on and help count and let her see the fun dentist tools. My daughter was very nervous and she was very understanding of that. There was no forcing or having to be demanding to do things. She said it best that it was like the first date while testing the waters. \nWe had Dr. Emily Whipple and she was FANTASTIC! Super quick in the exam. Explained everything so well to us, made us feel so welcomed and well taken care of.

Many people circle around the new arrival area because there is a lot of cool stuff there. What doesn't get bought from the new arrival section gets placed on the shelves. You can find lots of clothes and jewelry sometimes. I normally find a couple cd's. The record section is a little weak. I think there is a volunteer who gets the best records before he puts them on the shelf. Not to put down the employees though, they really are in general, pretty nice and friendly folks. People are always chatting and laughing together while working hard. They price everything real fairly too. You can get a buggy full of nice stuff for ten or twenty bucks. You might be careful when buying electronics, sometimes stuff doesn't work but sometimes it does work great. I got an old school Walkmen for like three bucks. I would suggest testing it out before purchasing. This is a non profit organization, so you can always be happy spending money here.

Alas, this is what we have to work with.\n\nI came looking for some Shrimp Paste, and while they had a small selection, they didn't have the exact brand I was looking for. That said, I don't think they have a Filipino grocery focus in general, so if you're looking for something Filipino-exotic, you may not find it.\n\nThe parking lot is really small. The staff seemed pretty friendly. They could really step up their Asian candy game.\n\nSince I go back\/forth from the bay area frequently, I am spoiled to have access to lots of other bigger grocery stores.

I was disappointed in most of the shrimp dishes including the shrimp cocktail, those shrimps were too small. The italian deli meats were good, but when the coppa was finished they just replaced it with more salami, talk about cheaping out. Most of the chinese dishes were pretty gross, the mexican food looked pretty good, but didn't get as far as to try it.

{"region":"WEST","text":"This is by far the worst experience I have ever had dealing with a company. If there was an option for zero stars, I would give them that. There was such a lack of communication throughout the whole process; I would go all day thinking my car was going to be ready when I was told it was, only to get a call a few minutes before they close telling me my car wasn't going to be ready and I was going to be without my car for another night. When I initially took my car in I was quoted a time frame of three weeks at the most to receive the quality paint job that I was paying for. They ended up having my car for five weeks, while telling me for those two additional weeks that my car would be done in two days and it never was. I complained to the owner, who seemed to hear me, and was granted about a $300 discount off of the $4000 work I was going to pay for. When I picked up my car I was very disappointed with the outcome. There were multiple runs in the paint, the buffing was done so poorly that it looked like my car had tiny scratches all over it, my inner door panel had scratches all over it due to their carelessness, some of the paint was already chipping, the underside of the doorhandles weren't even smoothed out and were rough to the touch, and the hydraulic struts that hold my hood up were broken. Not what I paid for. When I complained about the damage, they said they would fix it, but again I was without my car. This time, they actually paid for a rental, but only for a few days.  It took me almost two additional months of being blown off and complaining to the owner to get the damage rectified. When I told the owner how unacceptable the service was and how unhappy I was that it took three and a half months, damage to my car, and constant calls to get the initial product I payed for, he said he understood. I also complained multiple times about Frank, the employee with whom I had the most contact. Not only did he not keep me updated on the progress of my car, or lack thereof, he wasn't very friendly, and treated me as though I was the unruly customer for being unhappy with this awful service. Majority of the time when I called, Frank and the owner were not in the office and I wouldn't get a call back. This establishment has made me feel exhausted and defeated. The owner offered to have a service done to my car in attempts to appease my distaste for the service I was provided. That was a month ago. A month of calls with no return call. Finally today, I got a hold of Frank and was told only half of the service was going to be paid for. This should not have been a surprise, but I finally hit my limit. The tone that Frank spoke to me in was so condescending, he even went as far to tell me that other companies wouldn't have even offered to pay for any type of service on my car and he felt that fixing the damage they caused and putting me in a rental for a few days was above and beyond what even needed to be done; And that no refund of any amount could be provided because it would look like they were trying to cook their books. What type of professional says this to a customer? I am disgusted and so very disappointed. I can only imagine how many people they have treated like this. My paint is now chipping and Frank says it's covered under warranty, but is it worth taking my car back to end up with more damage? If you're reading this and have had a similar experience, please share it. There are only five reviews on here and people need to know what they're walking into. If you haven't been there, I highly suggest taking your hard earned money elsewhere. This establishment is not deserving. I will never go back to them for another paint job and am hesitant to have my chip fixed. I will be reporting them to the better business bureau and can only hope they work on not only taking more pride in their work but more care in how they treat customers.","stars":1}

But the food was tasty and we decided to return today and see if we might have a better experience. Nope.\n\nMy friend and I both ordered the tempeh sandwich. Mine with hummus instead of cheddar, and she with the cheddar. When the sandwiches came out, the waitress placed one in front of me, assuring me it was the vegan one. After eating some, it was clear it wasn't. So the waitress suggested we switch sandwiches. How unprofessional. We did, and though there was indeed no cheddar now, there was also so little hummus as to be nearly invisible. And the sandwiches were served with not so much as a chip or a sprig of parsley on the plate. It wasn't until I came home and looked up the menu online that we learned the sandwiches were supposed to come with a salad, but didn't.\n\nThe food and the service were really indifferent, we didn't get everything we paid for, and we won't return.  We've also shared our experience in local vegan Facebook groups. \n\nIt's a shame 5 Points doesn't try harder a little harder to court the plant-based customer, but thankfully more and more places do, so we don't have to settle for bad service, customer-shaming, and incomplete orders.","stars":1}

Brings the dish out and says something along the lines of \"it's gonna be a little spicy\". It was spicy but also neither me or my sister enjoyed it. We told the waiter we did not enjoy it and barely touched it outside tasting it clearly. He brings back the check with the dish on there. I spoke to the manager and said we did not like the rec and did not want to pay for it. She said \"you order food you pay for it\". No compromise w\/ a different order or anything.

It was later in the day so that may have impacted the quality.  Friends have said the pizza and bar were good.  We are both KCBS judges.  The 2 meat was meatloaf and ribs.  The sides and meatloaf were OK.  The ribs were just bad.  One piece was literally carbon, crunchy burned and the rest were severely overcooked but not carbon.  The fish was inedible.  It was a dry, brown chewy mess.  Literally was not something you could or would eat.  Wish we had gotten pictures.  The drinks were the best part of the meal.  The meatloaf not bad.

I had to wait an additional 10-15 minutes for my order.\n\nMy bf ordered the lobster tacos and he said they were very good. They included big meaty chunks of lobster. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were very, very good. The chicken was tender so I didn't need a knife to cut through. The guacamole was very good and the chips were just salty enough to go with the salsas they gave us. Oh! I loved that they included a serving of chips and 2 different salsas in the to go order. Both salsas were good and had a bit of spicy kick without being too much to handle.\n\nWe both enjoyed our meals from here. Will revisit when we're back in SB.","stars":4}

Yes the bar was full, but that's no excuse. I've been here 4 times and the service for tables is hit or miss. A couple of times it was good, 2 times ir was just too slow.

{"region":"WEST","text":"There is NO good Korean food in Reno, so We're happy there's something. I'm Korean and grew up eating amazing Korean food.  I lived in the Bay area for about 8 years before moving to Reno and was upset to learn there is no good Korean food here!\n\nI've been to Hana Garden several times, but was disappointed each time because I found a maggot in my rice and another time hair in my soup and stopped going there.  So I was really hoping this restaurant would be good.  And guess what?  It's not bad!  - in the Bay area and LA, it would be considered below average, but for Reno, it's good!  \n\nWe had both types of Galbi which were well seasoned and tasted authentic.  The spicy pork was pretty good.  The bulgogi was a little dry but they used a cut of meat that wasn't fatty enough and sliced too thick.  Actually if you look at pics from previous patrons, the bulgogi looked exactly right - maybe they ran out of the fattier meat tonight.  The Kimchi Jigae was good.  The only thing that didn't taste authentic was the Japchae.  I make my own Japchae at home which my husband loves - this one had too much soy sauce and sugar and not enough sesame oil.  In fact, that's the one missing ingredient in most of their food is lack of sesame seed oil. They also need to add seasoned carrots, spinach and shitake mushroom which is traditionally in japchae.   \n\nI'm soooo happy there's finally Korean BBQ though. For those who wrote reviews about wanting sushi - go to ijji 1,2 or 3.  Ijji 4 is Korean BBQ!   I would MUCH rather have Korean BBQ than Sushi any day! There's SO MUCH sushi in Reno, it's kinda gross!  We need variety and this place is a good start! \n\nSome tips for newbies:  \n- 2 tongs - one is for raw, and one is for cooked\n- 3 sauces on the side - soy based, sesame in the middle, a dry spice on the end (not familiar with this one).  You don't need to dip the marinated meats into these sauces.  This traditionally is for the unseasoned meats\/pork belly.  \n- Lettuce wraps - traditionally you cook plain pork belly, dip into the sesame sauce (and other sauces if you like), put a little spicy miso in the wrap, and add some cooked garlic slices (which they will provide), you can add some rice to the wrap if too salty and eat it. You can do this with marinated meats also but that's how you are supposed to eat the wraps.\n- meats - you're supposed to have a bit of a burnt sear on the edges without over cooking\/drying out the meat\n- scissors are to cut the meat\nBUT TRY THIS PLACE!!   Expand your horizons - try something new if you've never had Korean BBQ and get over sushi.  It's over-rated.","stars":4}

My flank steak was delicious, but I ordered it medium rare and it came out well done.

Had we previously known how huge it was we would have just split one burger and then split the fries. The service  was excellent. This is not a place to eat every day if you are on a budget. I honestly figured they would be a tad bit cheaper. I marked them down one star because a lot of things are an up charge on their menu.

{"region":"WEST","text":"Been going to this location for a while now and usually have a good experience.  Today was not the day hence the 4 not 5 star review.  Last year I had the premium membership and I think I used the massage tables twice and never the classes.  This year I dropped to the basic membership until I can really get into it.  Found out this time that they have a fitness evaluation and me being a big boy need all the help I can get.  I signed up for a session and my roommate had one as well.   I took the later evaluation since my time is more flexible.  I showed up early and checked in told the guy at the desk I was here for my 630 and I was a good 15 mins early, figured time to warm up.  About 625 saw the trainer looking around and figured this was my time, nope he had another person he was working with, so I walked away because I know that this was still the other persons time.  I can wait.  About 645 I went looking for what was going on.  It appears that he was still with the other person and got behind.  I get that but he didn't have the courtesy to say anything to me.  So my next evaluation is in 2 weeks because that is what is available.  I wonder if that one will be booked too.***UPDATE*** Dropped from a 4 to a 2 star for getting caught. The fitness manager called to see what the issue was and to see about how to handle my complaint.  She offered to see me at Thursday at 4pm...Ok but my roommate had her evaluation Thursday at 430pm, they were going to call her and ask her to come in later so they could get me in at 4.  Funny thing was that they had yet to say anything to her first.  That was not the right move.  She was not happy! And the Manager got caught.  She offered another time but when I said \"Wait I was told you are booked for the week\" She just said I will have my other clients move to take care of you.  No thanks I don't want that, so now I am at Platinum Fitness.","stars":2}

Dr. Hepp failed to give me the time, attention and correct diagnosis I required. Even though I had been a patient of his for almost two years I kept telling myself I was just being sensitive when I left his office feeling like I hadn't been heard or given the doctors attention to detail required. My end with him was when he dismissed me with the diagnosis of  \"just  a little knick in the gum that should heal on its own\".  I was in such pain and my gut told me there really was something wrong so I found another dentist to get a second opinion, who immediately put me on a 10 day round of antibiotics and referred me to an Oral Surgeon. In the words of the Oral Surgeon, \"I had a considerable infection\", and unfortunately for me required the tooth to be extracted. My new general dentist has also found two other areas that were misdiagnosed and now require more extensive work than had it been correctly addressed earlier.","stars":2}

{"region":"WEST","text":"I've been jonesing for some hush puppies and seeing this new fish and chips joint I sailed on over.  The hush puppies were great!  And six for $1.99 you can't go wrong.  They were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  However, they are not on any printed menu and I asked specifically for them based on other reviews.  They are not made in house either- straight from a freezer bag, but that does not bother me.\n\nSadly, besides the hush puppies and  low prices that was all that was enjoyable.  For $5.99 you get a five piece chicken finger combo, which includes a drink (canned) and fries.  Visually, the chicken looked great and the pieces were huge.  It was actually white meat from the tenderloin and not processed.   Unfortunately, the chicken was overcooked and dry inside.  It was so dry that chicken was almost hard.  The batter was lacking in flavor.  They do use a wet batter and not a dry batter.  The batter to chicken ratio was off.\n\nWhen you order chicken fingers, I expect a selection of sauces.  They did not offer any choices but served it with two cups of ketchup.  They could have saved money, as I do not eat ketchup.  They did have a nice selection of hot sauces on the counter.  But with my chips I love me some malt vinegar.  Reminds me of my youth, devouring some LJS.  I had to ask for some and they served it to me in a plastic cup out of a gallon jug.  I feel they should have some vinegar out for the customers.  I would have also appreciated some cocktail sauce.  Come on, at least a barbecue or America's favorite ranch.  \n\nThe fries were thick, not steak fry thick but a far cry from my favorite shoestring.  They could have been crispier, but that's just me.\n\nThey are new and business seemed good...hopefully they work out the kinks.  It is an open aired kitchen manned on this day by two cooks and a cashier.  Seating is tight and you may be sharing a picnic bench with some locals.","stars":2}

In addition it was the the middle of winter and they had all the doors open in the entire room  it was extremely windy and raining and I'm not sure what kind of affect or feeling they were trying to go for the restaurant but it was absolutely freezing cold everybody was wearing their jackets and I don't really think that the managers understand that people sitting down eating dinner don't want to be freezing their asses off.

It's not supposed to be an impressive side dish since it's commonly included in meals. \nAnd, the bathroom (oh boy it was a mess) it seemed neglected.

{"region":"WEST","text":"This is a cute little restaurant in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara.  There is limited seating and it's always crowded in there but I've never had to wait too long for a table.  The wait  is longer on a Saturday evening after 7 p.m. (up to 1\/2 hr).  The hostess and servers are accommodating.  Most of the time, I order take out so that alleviates any issues with having to park and walk around to State St. and wait to be seated.  I do a \"drive by\": I pull up to the sidecurb right in front of the restaurant, the passenger jumps out of the car and goes in to pick up the food, I drive around the block one time and back to the front of the resto to pick up the passenger and goods.  Score!!\n\nThe panang and red curry dishes (I like the brown rice option better) are delicious and so are the noodle dishes.  You can specify how spicy you want your dishes to be.. be careful of the green chilis if you request spicy.  They are scorching hot!!  The other night, I ordered the \"pumpkin curry with chicken\" dish and must say that it was one of the best curry (and interesting) dishes I've ever had. YUM!  I also always end up ordering the spicy mint noodles (it's tasty with beef).  The two dishes added up to be around $23 (take out, does not incl. tips).  Yes, Zen Yai may seem pricey but actually, the cost of a dinner for 2 is pretty comparable to other restaurants in downtown SB.","stars":4}

{"region":"WEST","text":"The best!! \nIn SB area most vet's are crazy expensive! If you're new to town, this is your guy.\nHe really cares about the pets and is a level headed and realistically priced doctor.\nWe took our dog to him for his whole life, but also went to other doctors. He was the first to notice a heart murmur when Willie was around a year old. Dr. Smith took care of Willie until he was probably 8 years old. We moved around a bunch and probably had him at 4-5 other vets. Toward the end of Willie's life we went to see a doctor who told us he couldn't do anything more for our dog unless we first paid $4000. That was not a possibility. We went for a second opinion and got a similar reply. They said lots of tests would need to be done. Each told us he had a month left. As a last ditch effort we brought our very ill dog to Dr. Smith. We should have gone to him first but when we moved back to the area, we didn't live in Carp. \n\nOnce we got back to Dr. Smith he examined Willie. We told him about what the other doctors said. He looked Willie over, listened to his heart and said, \"It's his heart murmur causing the problems. Here's some pills. It will help him for a while, but there really isn't much more that could done regardless of how deep your wallet is\". (that's a paraphrase but probably accurate enough. \n\nWe were hoping to get 6 months with him. After being told that one month was all he had left, we felt 6 months would be great and we'd be very thankful for that. Dr. Smith gave Wille some pills, changed us about $150 for the visit and Willie lived well over a year.\n\nWhen it was time to \"put him down\" Dr. Smith came to our house so Willie could die at home. He took him away and a short while later he had a beautiful box made with Willie's ashes in it. (his practice offers this service). \n\nDr. Smith was the best doctor to care for our dog and the most reasonable. There are many doctors that are more \"popular\" but if you want a doctor who cares and is realistic and helpful in treatment, Dr. Smith is your man.\n\nPS: EVERY time I went in there, the staff was fantastic...all of them. \n\nThanks Dr. Smith.

{"region":"WEST","text":"Another 5 star review to add to the Caje Coffee Roasters' repertoire. This coffee shop is fantastic. Cozy interior, beautifully decorated in farmhouse industrial decor. Lots of natural light pouring in from the store front windows. Lush foliage and greenery soften the metal and wood accents, while simultaneously purifying the air and adding a bit of zen. \n\nWhen I walked in, I was welcomed with a friendly greeting from the staff behind the counter. A practice I noticed maintained consistent for all guests who entered during my time there. It being my first time patronizing Caje, I naturally had questions and the staff were warm, pleasant and patient as they answered them. I just adore great customer service! Thank you Caje! \n\nTo drink, I opted for the Yemen, a sophisticated cafe mocha with a blend of coconut milk, condensed milk and whole milk and garnished with a toasted marshmallow. (Marshmallow? Dang right, I'm not passing that up!) \n\nFor eats, I chose the Chorizo Madelines and the Fancy Avocado Toast. You read that correctly, madelines, as in the cookies not the beloved fictional character I grew up reading stories about. The starch base of Caje's Chorizo Madelines are more reminiscent of corn bread in flavor and texture, than a sweet cookie, with small bites of chorizo baked into the batter. Sourced from Sama Sama daily, they are perfectly paired with honey butter and chives to garnish. The Fancy Avocado Toast is served on local favorite, Oat Bakery, bread, sliced thick. Unfortunately, the avocado on my toast was not fresh and had that bitter, earthy flavor that overripe avocado emits. Luckily, there were enough fresh garnishes (blueberries, cheese, etc) to make it palatable. \n\nCaje roasts their own coffee and makes their syrups in house. They also support reusable cups and presently do not offer a disposable cup option. Enjoy your beverage here in one of their mugs, bring your own vessel to take your java on the go, or use one of theirs for a nominal deposit. \n\nCaje is dog friendly, so bring your fur baby if you'd like. They also have free wifi although I was unable to successfully connect to it, and chose to create a personal hotspot instead.","stars":5}

We had tentatively 12-20 people, so I reserved 2 lanes (50% deposit down for 13 people in order to get those 2 lanes reserved) for one hour. Reno Axe was flexible and patient with our large party accommodation. We didn't realize that we all had to sign waivers and get wristbands prior to throwing axes, so we didn't get to axe throwing until 15 minutes after our reserved time, but they still let us throw axes for a full hour!!! We all had a lot of fun, and some of my coworkers even told me that they would love to bring their friends and family. We ended up having a total of 16 people. I think one hour is plenty of time for each person to throw axes since each lane has room for 2 throwers. \n\nAlso, I had one of their signature cocktails: the Bloodhound, which is composed of Tito's vodka, grapefruit juice and blood orange. I highly recommend that drink if you love something sweet.\n\nThanks Reno Axe for a great time!","stars":5}

They had ground beef, some chicken and pork and some buffalo, but no steaks or anything like that. The meat area was just really tiny.  They did have some interesting canned\/boxed items I've not seen elsewhere. Maybe we just went at the wrong time of the day or something, and I'll probably stop back in to check it out again at some point, but I was massively underwhelmed.","stars":2}

{"region":"WEST","text":"I really should have read the reviews prior to heading anywhere near this company.  Deceptive trade practices are an understatement.  The owner Carl is obnoxious and verbally abusive once the contract is signed, especially, when you call him on his deceit.   His daughter the finance administrator also is rude and indignant.   The audacity is the picture of Jesus one wall of the office. The sales man Jack is straight out obtuse. My next review will have the pictures of the tactics used to hide the extensive damage\/problems with the car I bought which was simply fragrant disregard for my life and the lives of my children. Their idea of safety check is getting it to pass SMOG.  And I am fairly confident that the car only passed because of the battery reset, because 2 days after I signed the contract and drove it, the engine light came on.    I bought a 2017 vehicle that was supposed to have manufacture warranty still available as it only had 35,000 miles.  I was told was abandoned by owner for financial reasons. Within 3 weeks after purchase, I had to have it put in the shop because the car was unsafe to drive. It had been in a collision (not disclosed) and there was damage that effected the car's safe ability to drive on the road.  When I called the sales rep to advise of the numerous problems with the car, he simply said to me \"I told you that car salesman lie and you could trust anyone, even me\"  When I spoke to the owner, he told me that I could trade it in somewhere. Or I could pay for all the parts to fix it (3800.00) and he would have is mechanic work on it...wouldn't that have been the way the car should have been sold in the first place, you know with the safety check on the car?  And would you, after finding all the hidden problems, trust the mechanic he has?   \n\nWell if you have been swindled by NEVADA TOWING you don't have to just take it.  \n\nNevada's deceptive trade practices are helpful, but are generally limited to prosecuting deception after it occurs.  For information on local swindles, and or to report a person or a local business engaging in deceptive business practices, contact a state consumer protection office. Along with in-state resources, federal organizations like www.consumeraction.gov, and nationwide nonprofits like the Better Business Bureau at (www.bbb.org) and www.fraud.org can assist you with consumer fraud complaints, from filling out the complaints online to finding the appropriate local, state, and federal agencies with which to file a complaint.","stars":1}

I appreciate Paul's guidance on a better solution.\n\nI didn't have anything fixed yet at Powell Garage, so I am not able to state how their work is, however I will go back to them as I feel they are a trusted mechanic source which guided me to around a $700 savings.","stars":5}

The salad was WONDERFUL, but it was really small I wanted more!  The fries didn't taste so wonderful they tasted like cold old fries you get at drive thru.  \n\nWhen it came time to pay there was a little confusion with the wait staff.  I had a $50 gift card, and wanted to use it on the entire bill and was very clear about it, but for some reason they only used it on part of the bill, after two tries on making the bill right 3rd time was a charm, and we got it squared away, and everyone was happy.\n\nAfter dinner my friend decided to go to the bar and stay for one more drink before we head home.  While at the bar I accidentally spilled my glass of water and cut my finger on the broken glass, the bartender was wonderful and took care of the spill right away, and got me some ointment and band aid.

If you have lived in Pima County long enough, especially since elementary school, chances are, you have had set foot on the premises at least twice for field trips. This last time, I was doing an assignment for a science class I was enrolled in at PCC. \n\nAs a animal lover myself, I got a kick out of seeing our furry friends that we don't usually see every day, and it made me see the Sonoran desert in a different light. How often do you see majestic bobcats, mountain lions, and ocelots just hanging out? Not often. How about foxes? Bighorn sheep? I was able to see all my favorites.

Of course she wanted me to go with her, okay chauffer.  So my reward was going to a coffee shop.\n \nAtmosphere - Last time I was here it was Battle Born Caf\u00e9 and you would not even recognize the place.  The place has a lot of famous people's mug shots.  I love the Johnny Cash sitting for his mug shot.  The wood is what stood out to me, the long counter against the wall was great.\n\nDrinks - Coffee of course and my go to is mocha.  Because I ordered the large I got a paper cup.  My wife ordered a standard size and got a mug.  If I am staying in I want a mug.  We I receive my coffee I want it to the point I cannot drink it. I want it to be too hot.

I like the imperfection of an egg poached in water (but WITHOUT vinegar...don't even get me started on that). The service was a bit rushed and the water was spilled on us and the coffee was brought without the milk I asked for, yada yada yada.

I understand that sometimes cooks want to be creative but that was really a wrong match.

{"region":"WEST","text":"This is my favorite park in Tucson besides Reid Park.\n\nFirst of all, it is a huge park. It comprises two little lakes, a dog park, a very large green area, and equally big sandy walking areas.\n\nThe grass is so green and pretty and soft. I love walking my dog on the grassy area. The grass area is so big that you can just walk in circles and it will still not be too repetitive. Walking alongside the lakes is also nice. The ground there is sandy but it is still very pretty. There are many trees all over the park, which adds to the beauty of the park and also provides shade when you need to take a break. There are trash cans and drinking fountains all over as well and everything is very clean and well-maintained.\n\nThe dog park is great as well. It is divided into a small park (for small dogs, I suppose) and a bigger park. The small park is just dirt but the bigger park has a grassy area. There are benches and some trees for shade. There is a water hose and a tub, so you can clean your dog if the dog got dirty, which I find super convenient! Also, some people left toys there, so you don't even need to bring your own toys. You can just play with the ones that are already there.\n\nThe crowd that comes here is mostly people fishing in the lake and people walking their dogs. A lot of the dog walkers are people volunteering at the dog shelter that is close by. They take the shelter dogs for a walk. So be prepared to meet many dogs when you come here. However, the shelter dogs seem to actually be some of the more well-behaved dogs. In general, there is never any problem. Everyone just peacefully walks their dogs. In addition to fishers and dog walkers, there are sometimes people flying their model airplanes or playing with their model motorboats. The motorboats are very loud, so that can be a little annoying. Speaking of noises, sometimes you can hear the dogs from the shelter nearby barking. I personally don't mind and my dog just ignores it but if that is something that bothers you, this park might not be ideal for you.\n\nAll in all, this is a really great park. I love coming here.","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"I have been coming to this Filiberto's ever since it replaced the old Carl's Jr. It's nice to have a Mexican fast food joint nearby as a drive thru; I got tired of driving a greater distance to Nico's, to get out of the car and wait on what was becoming mediocre food. For the most part, the food and service are all on-point with few exceptions.\n\nIf you have ever been to a Los Beto's, El Saguarito, Potosino's or any of the home-grown Mexican drive thrus, you will see that Filiberto's is of the same caliber. With that, you should expect the food and service to be similar-- they are. When I first started coming here, I ordered the burritos; those are probably what Filiberto's is known for, and yes, they are very good. But I have since moved on to the lengua (beef tongue) tacos, and I'd be hard-pressed to find something else on the menu that I like equally. Well, okay-- I would not kick their weekend menudo out of bed for eating crackers, but I digress. Back to the tacos: they're very simple; diced-up beef tongue with cilantro, onions, little salsa verde on top, and an ice-cold cup of horchata to wash it all down, and you've got a match made in heaven!\n\nAfter considering what they get so right when it comes to food, it is puzzling why they get some other things so wrong. Recently, they began offering a tamale plate that I thought looked very tempting. How could I not? I love a good tamale. Well, these \"tamales\" were not exactly what I was expecting. I've lived here all my life, and have probably consumed more tamales than the average person throughout my lifetime. These did not taste like tamales at all. The red chile and meat were sort-of right, but should the masa taste like Fritos? Because it did. The flavor was unlike any tamale I've ever had. I wasn't grossed out, just disappointed.\n\nThe service can be quite decent if a tad slow. Some days, it's incredibly slow. So slow that I try to see if I can identify complete chaos through the window. There never is chaos. Just a below-average amount of people dining in, and a car (if that) in front of me. Additionally Some of the girls at the window go a bit cheap on the salsa. Interestingly enough, all of the Mexican fast-food joints are guilty of those two things, though I don't think those are enough to warrant a refusal to patronize those businesses. The food is just too good (for the most part) and life is too short to only get Taco Bell.\n\nWell, thanks to this review, I'm now in the mood for some more lengua tacos, and it's safe to say I won't stop going any time soon.","stars":3}

They also have the absolute best bloody mary's in town, with your choice of green chile vodka, pepper-infused gin (my personal favorite), or bacon-washed rye.  They come with enough olives and veggies in them to make them a meal on their own.  47 Scott also makes one of the best bellinis in town, which can be hard to come by.\n\n2) Phyllo-wrapped chicken!  This is my absolute favorite dinner entree in Tucson.  Goat cheese.  Flaky phyllo dough.  Juicy chicken breast.  If you're veggie, I recommend the stuffed red peppers as an incredibly delicious alternative.\n\n3) Cocktails!  Sister business Scott & Co. next door is probably the best place in town to get a cocktail with its vast and ever-changing menu, but 47 Scott has a consistently delicious cocktail menu as well.

If you're in a hurry for decent food, this is a good place to go (assuming you're willing to take the risk). \n\nMy other complaint is that all of the drinks are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, which anyone who is health-conscious tries to avoid, but this is par for the course pretty much anywhere except places that sell canned and bottled drinks, such as L&L.\n\nThe food (and service!) earn 3 stars, but the unsafe environment costs them a star for a total of 2 stars.","stars":2}

I only payed $75 to stay here on a Friday night, and the room was so nice, it felt like I should've been paying more. There was an excellent view of the city, and the mountains beyond. I would presume, due to the design and location, that most rooms in this place should have some kind of nice view. There is alot to do in Grand Sierra, even if you aren't a gambler. They have a full size bowling alley, which was fun along with some pizza and beer. There is also a movie theater, arcade, spa, pool, indoor golf, shopping, restaurants, several bars, live music, and probably other things I am forgetting at the moment. There are so many amenities here, there really isn't a need to go to downtown Reno unless you want to. \n\nThere are only two minor negatives that I can think to mention. First, someone on the floor\/room above me was thumping around quite a lot fairly early in the morning, which woke me up. I couldn't tell for sure if it was kids playing, or housekeeping cleaning up. Earplugs would be a nice precaution to bring along if you wish to sleep in. Secondly, there didn't seem to be a bath mat, so I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use an extra towel on the floor instead. The showers are designed with swinging glass doors with no tracks, which allows some water leakage under the door. Again, not a huge problem but it might be mildly annoying if staying more than one night as you would have to likely walk through or avoid water on the floor in order to get to the toilet. \n\nGrand Sierra is very close to the Reno-Tahoe airport, which is why I chose to stay here, as I was flying the next day. Usually I stay downtown. But I was really surprised and impressed at how nice everything was here, and that there was so much to see and do, that I didn't get bored or feel like I was missing out on anything by not staying downtown. I didn't want to leave so soon. I will definitely come again in the future.","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"I absolutely love the menu here! They have so much to offer for a very reasonable AYCE price. If you are new to kbbq, definitely ask for help, because the menu can be a little overwhelming. \n\nThe fried gyoza appetizer came with a very unique sauce that I ended up dipping a lot of my meats in. It is so tasty!! I think it has some hints of Chinese red vinegar. Definitely order the gyoza or at least ask if you can get a side of the dipping sauce. \n\nOut of the meats, my favorites were the brisket, lemongrass pork belly, galbi, tri tip bulgogi, fresh shrimp, sat\u00e9 chicken and the brisket bulgogi! I don't usually order chicken at kbbq, but SIU gives you small plates, so you aren't loaded with too much of one meat. The sat\u00e9 chicken is marinated in a delicious peanut sauce that was very unique to anything I've tried at other kbbq joints. The pork belly is a little too thin for my liking, but it tastes very good with the lemongrass marinade. I liked the fresh shrimp over the marinaded shrimp, because the marinade got quite sticky after grilling. It made for very sticky hands and was not really worth the mess since you peel most of the marinade off. We did pretty good and ordered most of the meats on the menu, and you really can't go wrong with any of the choices!\n\nIf you're a little more daring, try the beef intestine or the calamari steak. The intestine has a delicious briny taste to it. My friends wouldn't touch it but I was able to eat a whole order to myself because it was so good! I liked dipping mine with vinegar, because it cuts the aftertaste that you might get from eating it alone. The calamari steak was a little thick but still very yummy. I dipped that one in the gyoza sauce. \n\nI think they could add some more veggies\/sides to their menu but I really loved the oyster mushrooms!\n\nI came for the soft opening, so I don't want to be a harsh critic of their service but it definitely needs some attention. The first two rounds of apps\/meats came out relatively quickly, but after that we were left staring at an empty grill for quite some time. We had to hunt our server down to order more food, then we had to remind him to bring out our food after sitting idly with grumbling stomachs.  The server didn't explain anything to us, so if I hadn't been a kbbq regular, we would have been lost sheep. \n\nWith authentic Asian food often comes sub par service, so I'll take what I can get. I'm in love with the diverse menu and the cheap price (compared to other AYCE Kbbq in the area). I'll definitely be back for more!!!","stars":4}

We haven't been there in a while due to the street construction, then the limited seating issues. Craving good burgers, we decided to do carryout. No problems at all with that, great service and timing all the way. Husband ordered the Dirty Sanchez, and enjoyed it. (All he cared about were the peppers and meat, forget the lack of cheese!)The tater tots were great, but then, it's pretty hard to mess up a basic tater tot. Now the problems start. First daughter's Hawaii Five-O had barely any sauce, Lindy's or Teriyaki, and if there was cheese on there, you couldn't tell. The pineapple was so hard, she had to pull it off. Second daughter's OG had the opposite problem. It was so drenched in the house sauce, she couldn't eat it and this is a kid who can handle spice. I had the Texas Belt buckle and it was dry, barely if any cheese, and perhaps a teaspoon of BBQ sauce. The bacon was nice and crispy, I'll give them that, but even my BBQ sauce at home couldn't rescue the dryness. The onion rings on my burger,  and the basket we ordered, could have been good, but they were cooked to just under burning. We could have got burgers and rings at Carl's Junior better than this. With all of the new burger places springing up in Tucson, Lindy's needs to step up their game. This isn't the time to slack off, the Man vs. Food show was years ago. I gave them 3 stars because I remember great food there and we received great service, but I don't know if we'll be back.

{"region":"WEST","text":"I too wish I could give no stars, but that isn't an option. On April 19, I mailed two amended tax returns from Mail Depot for my 83-year-old father, who was recovering from knee replacement surgery. The pleasant lady (with the glasses) weighed the envelopes and asked that I write the return address in the upper lefthand corner of each. In addition, the IRS returns were in preprinted window envelopes and she certainly would have noticed if the addresses were illegible. I paid to have them sent CERTIFIED mail.\n\nShe wrote the amount of postage required on each envelope and asked Bill Hemphill, the owner, to make sure he put postage on the envelopes as she handed them to him. A week later, one of the envelopes was returned marked \"Undeliverable No Postage\" or words to that effect. In the upper righthand corner was the postage amount written in pencil by the nice lady who wears glasses. Mail Depot never put postage on an important certified document!\n\nA few days later, my father, still recovering from knee surgery, took the returned envelope to the car to take back to Mail Depot, but somehow -- and even he isn't sure how it happened. The envelope and some other papers he was carrying were lost. They may have blown off the roof of the car.\n\nWe waited a few days hoping someone would find the package and return it to our mailbox, but to no avail. I checked the certified mail tracking number and discovered that the other envelope made it to its Fresno CA destination. The other piece of mail that had been returned to us and lost (containing my parents' most personal financial and identity information) was listed as Undeliverable as Addressed. It was undeliverable because Bill put no postage on it.\n\nYesterday my father and I returned to Mail Depot to explain what had happened. All we asked was for a refund on the package that hadn't been delivered. There were two helpful staff members who copied our receipts. One was the nice lady with the glasses, who had originally waited on me. The other apologized profusely and told us that she had to talk to her boss. She also asked that we specify that Bill, the owner, was the one working the day I mailed the documents, because apparently he doesn't really understand the business. (I got the impression these two employees are embarrassed by their boss's incompetence.)\n\nToday, we received a call from Gina, who is either the manager or Bill's sour \"enforcer\" of the place, telling us that we could come in and collect our $5.17 refund. So we stopped by Mail Depot and met Bill, who told us we needed to talk to Gina. He called her and after waiting 5 minutes, she returned to the store. Gina then said that she had further investigated the matter and the fact that it was marked Undeliverable as Addressed didn't specify that the postage had never been placed on the envelope. In other words, she accused me and my father of lying! We paid for the postage; we paid to have it sent certified. What difference does it make as long as she knows the package isn't going to arrive at its destination? She explained that she would have to explain to the postal investigator why she had given out government money in the form of a refund and we lacked the proper proof. \n\nJust on a customer service level, if she truly was worried about having to justify a mistake to the USPS, why wouldn't she take $5.17 out of the store's petty cash to satisfy and keep a frequent patron. \n\nIf you read this, PLEASE BOYCOTT this absolutely incompitently-run postal facility, whose management is psychopathically stingy and RUDE! I have formally complained to the Arizona Daily Star, the USPS, and the Better Business Bureau.","stars":1}

{"region":"WEST","text":"It's so great to see the revitalization of downtown, and this joint is definitely part of that.  Generally speaking, the food was good. The portions felt a bit small for the money, but we overordered and overate anyway. \n\nHubby wanted to try the yucca tots and I wanted the duck skin chicharrones, but when we ordered the girl at the counter suggested that we order the yucca smothered with cheese and covered with chicharrones. This was a mistake for me. I loved the yucca and I loved the duck skin--they were both excellent--but I hated the cheese, which was like nacho sauce, sort of thin and waxy. Next time I will follow my instinct and just get what I want. This came with spicy ketchup that I did not try, because I find ketchup repulsive.  \n\nI didn't care for the cheese in the quesadilla either, but my stepdaughter loved it. I caught her picking the cheese out and just eating that, although the tortilla was perfectly crisp. Stepson ordered a burrito with beans, cheese, and chicken. It was huge. Also tasty, but I also didn't care for the cheese. He said he liked it, but he didn't eat much (this is not indicative of anything; he doesn't eat much pretty often). Both kids were disappointed not to find refritos\/pinto beans here. They serve white beans, which have a very distinctive flavor, sweet and creamy. I liked them, but the kids aren't used to things that are different. \n\nOn to the tacos. I chose grilled chicken, duck mole, and steak. Husband ordered the special tacos: prime rib, atlantic cod, and smoked port belly. I enjoyed all of mine. The meat was delicious and perfectly cooked, and the tortillas were decent. However, I did not care for the crema. It didn't seem like a good balance to the flavors, and was just cold and soggy. The prime rib taco was also great, and the fish taco was completely battered and fried, so it had a lot in common with eating a piece of fry bread. I didn't try the pork. \n\nThese are not traditional tacos, but creative and thoughtful ones with interesting ingredients and flavor combinations. They taste fresh and healthy.","stars":4}

Just as the baby was falling asleep (about 11:30) the front desk called to say we should have checked out already. Then, after clearing that up, just as the baby was falling asleep again, housekeeping pounded on the door and woke him up again. We personally went to the front desk and suggested there needs to be better communication among the staff; they agreed and apologized. Shortly after lunch, I saw the mini-bar lady (only 2 doors away from our door) and asked her to please NOT go to room our - explained that my husband was trying to get the baby to sleep (for the 3rd time), she asked if we needed anything and I assured her we didn't. within 2 minutes, she knocked on the door and yelled \"MINI BAR\".  Now, with only about an hour left and any hopes of a nap for our little guy - i settled him down, and wouldn't you know it, another employee pounds on our door (he had towels; we didn't ask for towels!) --- OH! and I should mention - we put the \"NOT NOW\" sign IN the door lock yet they still disturbed us. The hotel is cute, but not being afforded the opportunity to rest peacefully has left us extremely disappointed in this hotel. Although the location is nice, I am not sure we will ever have enough faith that the staff is competent enough to communicate with each other and give us the privacy (rest) we need. A very, VERY disappointing experience indeed! \n\nYou should also note that the hotel does NOT have A\/C.

{"region":"WEST","text":"I get where they are trying to go with this place, and that's to be an all-inclusive establishment, hence the 'resort' part of their name.  Honestly, though for me and my friend, it was underwhelming.  If you don't want to leave the hotel you're staying in, you don't require much nightlife or entertainment, and you aren't picky about your food\/drinks, then maybe this is the place for you.  \n\nNow granted we were there midweek but it still felt empty and a bit lackluster.  There was some construction right in the middle of the restaurant\/bar area too, which sucked.  Overall.. it just seemed... boring.  \n\nThat being said, our room was affordable and clean, beds were rather comfy and all of the staff that we encountered were very friendly and professional.  I have no complaints about staying the night here.  I must give at least 3 stars for that.  \n\nThe only reason I booked a room here was because I bought tickets to see Florence + The Machine.  The theater here is AWESOME for concerts.  I enjoyed having a choice between cozy round booths or table seating as opposed to just row by row of chairs stuck too close to one another.  It was comfortable and the sound was great.\n\nAs for the drinks and food here.. ehhhh, well.  We tried the Cantina, and I discovered the most overcooked shrimp on the planet.  Salty margaritas were... salty.  The bartender who gave us some tequila tastings was great though.  \n\nI found it extremely off putting that one of the restaurants here (Caf\u00e9 Sierra?) has different hours of availability for their different types of food, and the menu is not in any order whatsoever.  You can get Asian cuisine but only until 10pm.  So I was SOL for that pad thai I was craving because it was 10:21pm.  Balls to that.  \n\nIf I attend another concert here, I will most likely shell out the extra bucks to stay at the Silver Legacy and cab it over for the show.\n\nPs.  Don't order the mojito unless you like the whole mint plant in your glass.  LOL.","stars":3}

He then called back on a Friday four times and smoke with four different managers trying to get ahold of a person doing the hiring for the position. She was nowhere to be found all day, so messages had to left with managers on duty. I witnessed this myself. Next day comes and no return calls, whole weekend passes no return calls, to the point that now I'm pissed off. I call and speak to the hiring personnel.

After my underwhelming experience I read the reviews as I ate. \nFirst, I came to the counter and checked out the toppings. Two gals were behind the counter checking about relationship issues. They saw me. No hello. I left the check out the other menus next door then came back for a burger. They were still chatting. I stood there reading the menus for a while. Then saw the register and thought maybe I was suppose to stand and order there when I was ready. So I did. Stand. And stand. Again they looked at me and continued their conversation. Surely if they were close they would tell me. One was cleaning the grill so I asked. Are you still open? They both turned and one confirmed yes and continued chatting. It was VERY important. I paused and though wow I'm out of here just at he moment one turned and asked if she could help me. What I novel idea. I hesitated as I still thought it best to leave based on the juju. I didn't. She cooked my burger to leather. Payback I guess for disrupting such a peacefully time. I got the grilled onions, cold with no clear idea of how old. Still flavorful but weird. The only reason for the one star was the freshly made sweet potato fries. Reading the reviews staff common curtesy or sense is absent perhaps in management as well. In the really world this would be closed in a month. However, they have a captive customer base so I expect they stick around a little longer. Great concept. Good price point for an airport.

{"region":"WEST","text":"My work brings me to Reno once every two months so I am so excited that a non-gaming, non-smoking hotel has opened up.  We recently stayed here (two eight year olds in tow) and had a very good experience.  We stayed on the concierge level and our room was very neat and clean.  One complaint that I had as a business traveler is that the room did not have enough good lights.  The lighting they have is beautiful and clearly expensive but to only have one light for reading in bed (so if you have a person in each queen bed, only one can read) is really not acceptable.  Also, when I wanted to do work in the room, I needed more light than was offered.  The staff are incredibly nice and helpful-they do tend to give mixed messages---I called to find out about the concierge breakfast and was told that it included both hot and cold items; it did not (at least on the days that we were there).  Not a big deal as we are all fine with cold items but they staff need to get on the same message---this happened a few times throughout our stay.  Hopefully just new opening kinks that they need to work out.  The set up of the climbing walls on the second floor is AMAZING---my kids went back three times in one day and LOVED it.  The people running the BaseCamp are incredibly friendly (I was thinking that they would all be snooty climbers) and were great with the kids.  The kids even climbed the wall on the outside of the hotel and there was a staff member there the whole time watching them and teaching them.  We will definitely be back-hopefully if they improve the lighting I can recommend this hotel to my company which has a lot of business travelers come through Reno.  Keep up the good work.","stars":4}

{"region":"WEST","text":"Was only able to golf the front nine (see below), but it is a nice, fun layout. The course has somewhat narrow fairways and not much room to work with if you miss right. However, it's not an overly long course so most people can probably get away with using a wood, hybrid, or long iron off the tee. While the course was fun, it's not in the best condition. The tee boxes look neglected and there are lots of areas that could use some extra care. The greens were very rough. They look like they were probably aerated a few weeks ago, but the problems aren't just limited to that. There appears to be dead spots and areas that could use some extra care. I think if the greens were in better shape, the other aspects of the course wouldn't really matter. But putting on these greens made it very frustrating. \n\nDespite all that, I would still probably play again since the prices are so low ($17.99 for 18 and cart). But my main complaint is that the restaurant was already closed when we went to order food at the turn. Keep in mind it was a weekend and only 1:45 pm. We didn't eat lunch prior to starting, and the golf carts advertise ordering food on hole 8. Once you get to hole 8, there's a large board with the menu. When we went to order, we were told they were already closed. We couldn't play the back 9 because we had to leave to go eat. \n\nAll in all, not a bad course. Fun layout, but not in the best condition. Also, beware that their restaurant closes early.","stars":3}

First I went to pick up a pizza I'd ordered on the phone and they had lost the order somewhere, second was I picked up the pizza and didn't check it and it had the wrong ingredients on it and then just now I went to pick up the pizza after the indicated 20 minutes and they had gotten busy all the sudden, so they hadn't even started it.  I had to wait 15 minutes for them to make and cook it.  You'd think they'd be apologetic or maybe offer you a beer while you wait or something, but no.  Nothing is said or done.  It doesn't seem like there's ever anyone of authority there.  We used to see the owner there but haven't seen him in ages.  Like I said, this is great pizza so I hope they fix the problems with this location.  I won't give up on them yet.","stars":3}

Such great customer service! We were able to taste incredible great beer. I can honestly say, there wasn't one that I didn't like. The Spring Fling and the Sneaky Red were my favorites. They had yummy, fresh, warm popcorn that we ate tons of. There is a giant Viking grill that customers can use while visiting the brewery. I've visited quite a few breweries, but this was the best. This California girl will definitely be back, and recommend to friends.","stars":5}
{"region":"WEST","text":"This has definitely become my new favorite place to grab some tasty tacos and drinks. The tacos themselves are never greasy\/oily and each bite is perfectly seasoned and cooked. I have been here a couple of times and my food has never been over cooked or dry. They offer a large variety of proteins to choose from as well as veggie options. My personal favorite out of all of them is definitely the al pastor, the meat is super flavorful and pineapples add a hint of sweetness for contrast. If you're a really big taco lover they even have an all you can eat taco option which I've never seen before in other restaurants. \n\nThe restaurant itself is on the smaller side but they also offer outdoor dining as well. The ambiance is bright and clean and I really enjoy the colorful presentation of the food and drinks. The service is always friendly and they even gave us samples of the elote and arroz con leche which is definitely a must try! I normally wouldn't get it as a dessert but it's so good y'all. Honestly everything here is delicious and I can't wait to be back to try more appetizers and desserts.","stars":5}

We had the Tom Kha as a starter and even though it wasn't very spicy it was as good as any I've ever had - a friend of mine used to call it Angel Spit Soup since it tastes like something heavenly. This soup qualified for that description. We also had the Lychee Curry - the lychee adding a nice exotic touch to the curry. All this went down very well with Chang beer. Service was very attentive.

As a result of having to wait, my drink was upgraded to a larger size for free. I got a thai tea with black pearls. The tea was great and wasn't too sweet. I like that they made sure I liked it before sending me off with a drink I didn't enjoy. \n\nThe boba was a little tough and harder to chew than most boba I've had in town.

I paid for the time he was there plus also paid an additional $280 2 weeks advance, 2 weeks he did not go since I pulled him out of the school. They're refusing to give me a refund because I was to have given a 2 week withdrawal notice despite the fact my son was only enrolled there for 2.5 weeks, so that doesn't make sense. I can POSSIBLY understand a company's point of view but as a customer, why are you keeping my money you didn't earn? The facility didn't care for my son those days therefore shouldn't free pocket MY $280. There was always different teachers in his class, never knew them by name, once there were two new teachers in there together in the evening (I'd never seen them before, they were wearing matching polo yellow shirts) and one was complaining about how she is sick (it was obvious too), probably why my son got sick.\nSo if you're testing the waters with new child care facilities keep that in mind especially if it doesn't end up working out!","stars":1}

I wouldn't mind staying here again if we had a bunch of grandparents with us again, but probably not if it was just my family. \n\nPros:\n-Clean, comfortable\n-The swimming pool area! Had the fancy LED multi colored lights and fire torches going on!\n-Could accommodate a family of 7 in one unit.\n-Location to airport\/freeway is good\n\nCons:\n-Outdated decor. Though things were \"clean\" everything had that used feeling to it. The carpet in the hallway was coming up in places too. \n-the breakfast was nothing to get excited about. It was \"fresh\" but fresh in the sense that they just opened up a package of something and put it out.  There's no made to order anything, except the waffles you can do yourself. \n-the service was slow up front of the house. I think they were understaffed because we got there an hour early, the front said our room was ready but just needed 5 minutes to finish it up. Well a whole hour later it wasn't ready.

{"region":"WEST","text":"Paseo Nuevo is an interesting creature.  It's kind of a \"mall within a mall\", located in downtown Santa Barbara.  One COULD argue that State Street itself could be considered a Mall of sorts in itself - since it has many of the stores, eateries, entertainment options and services that many more \"traditional\" malls do.  But Paseo Nuevo is a separate mall\/shopping center that branches off from State Street, straddling the blocks near Carrillo and Canon Perdido.\n\nSimply put, its the glamorous city of Santa Barbara's version of a mall; and, well, its kinda neat!  Its an outdoor shopping center with at least 70 different stores in it.  There are shops of all kinds in here tailoring to a wide range of budgets and interests.  Don't get me wrong, there are no stores in here that sell things DIRT CHEAP of course.  This is Santa Barbara after all!  But the shops in here vary from reasonably priced to what some in the area call \"SB Pricey\".\n\nPaseo Nueveo features many of the shops you'd find at your typical \"Galleria\" type of mall.  Macy's, Nordstroms, Sephora, Saks, American Eagle, Banana Republic, Claire's, Bath and Body Works, Teavana and many many more!  Quite a few you've probably never even heard of. too!  There's even a movie theater and an art gallery, as well as a Forever 21 (though its not technically in this shopping center, its right across the street on State Street...so it's \"close enough\".\n\nUnlike other similar places, there's no food court here per se.  Instead, the eateries are spread out throughout the shopping center, located here and there.  I kind of like this, as it sort of encourages the shopper to stroll further into the place to peruse and explore and perhaps pause to eat along the way.\n\nThe atmosphere of the shopping center is light and airy with, as another Yelper put it, a lovely European feel to it.  There are little areas where you climb or descend a few steps and paths that branch off the two main \"roads\" that branch off State Street.  These paths wander this way and that and have shops on either side.  There are plenty of places to sit and rest - with a few circular seating areas that encourage socializing.  The public restrooms are a bit off the beaten path, being upstairs near the art gallery - but they are clean and well-maintained.\n\nWhat's kind of interesting is how it's easy to lose yourself in this shopping center for awhile, browsing and shopping until you complete the entire circuit of the paths and then realize.. \"oh yea... I'm just barely off State Street\".\n\nThis \"mall\" gets four solid stars from me.  What denies it a fifth star is that fact that, when the wife and I were here last week, we discovered that the Paseo Nuevo's management had just raised the rent on many of the tennants.  As a result, both Yankee Candle store and Viva Oliva in this location are going out of business.  I realize that this is a pricey area...but still.  We are coming OUT of a recession and you'd think the management here would want as many tenants as possible here to not only make them money, to provide tax revenue for the City of Santa Barbara, but also to provide the customers with a good mix of shopping options and experiences here.  Raising rents to the point where businesses have to leave is a bit backwards, in my opinion.\n\nStill and all... Paseo Nuevo is certainly worth a good hour or two (or more!) or exploration time when your in Santa Barbara.","stars":4}

Apparently the owner used to be a swimmer so she made sure there was a good lap pool.\n\nThis has everything you would need in a workout club. Trainers that are well trained, every type of machine, three weeks, racquetball rooms, basketball court and even has a health\/book beauty salon or something where you can get massages and have your wife get pampered for a bit. \n\nDuring this Covid time, they have color days where each machine has different colors squares and when you walk in if it's a blue square day you're only supposed to get on machines that have a blue square. I'm not sure if the mandatory mask thing is an issue here as I don't see compliance. I don't think it's very doable to work out hard and have to try to breathe through a mask. Also in order to get in the pool now you have to reserve lanes. Four lanes can get a little tight. \n\nAlso the sauna and Jacuzzi are closed for the time being. I do miss the Jacuzzi.

THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL A V.I.P. EXPERIENCE.  \n\nOur first stop was at Beckman Vineyards with Kip. He was able to breakdown everything about wine and the history of that massive vineyard. Helped my mom and I learn without our heads spinning. He was pretty much like a Bill Nye the Science guy with wine, but even cooler. There is no stupid question about wine & it's process you could ever ask with Kip. Actually, the more you asked, the more excited he got which was fun to be part of. We tried about 5-7 wines and walked out buying 3 bottles.\n\nNext stop was at the lovely Carhartt Vineyards. We were lucky enough to have the ebullient Brooke and her handsome son Chase Carhartt stop by, after being serenated with their incredible wine  & history by one of their workers (can't remember this cuties name). They were very pleasant and you could chat with them all day. We even had lunch there provided by Scott with a cheese platter and our pre-ordered lunch items. We decided to buy a bottle of Chardonnay from them as well! Looking forward to hearing about their upcoming Rose.\n\nThe next stop was at Brave and Maiden vinery. Holy cow this place is beautiful. My mom and I got to see their oak & stainless steel barrels and enjoyed sipping a couple of their wines as well. We bought a Rose after touring around a bit and soaked up the sun for the rest of the day.\n\nGoing in the spring only allows you to see the budding of all the grapes to come. We have to come back when they have all blossomed and ready for picking before being placed into the bottle. Needless to say, we bought their Rose.\n\nThis trip and personal one on one experience will never be forgotten, but will be revisited and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I honestly don't know how 2 guys alone run this company. It's not only genius, its WINE-TASTIC!\n\nThank you for taking such good care of my mother and I.","stars":5}

Chips & salsa were great and I love that you can try additional salsas for $1. Food is \"expensive\" but nothing to complain about.

{"region":"WEST","text":"Not sure what happened today but I left feeling like I won't come back. I've been coming to this place since they opened and today was a huge let down. The girl who did my pedicure did not file my heels or sides of my toes. I think she forgot to do it and then took the cheese grater thing to my feet and ran it over my heels 3 times. When I showed her that I still had dead skin all over she acted annoyed and got the manager. They kept saying that I did the pedicure 1 which meant they don't address the dead skin? I understand not spending 5 minutes per foot to remove dry skin, but to not even spend 1 minute per foot seems like a total ploy to get you to spend an extra $10 to do the pedicure 2. For $50 I feel ripped off and the way the girl handled it was unprofessional. I have been loyal to them, brought my daughters for pedicures and my mother and grandmother now go there because of me. If this is the kind of establishment they run, I'll look elsewhere and so will my family","stars":2}

I called around town and so far wolf pack movers offered the most overall.\n\nI called wolf pack moving back in May 2021, over a month before my actual move out day. I spoke with Kevin and he was very professional, straight forward, gave me the price breakdown, what to expect, and answered all my questions. They were the only place that offered the muscle and truck to move your boxed up crap to the next destination, while other places offered only the muscle and you had to get your own truck and\/or supplies. I was told to get the most out of my move: make sure everything was packed, ready to go, and if they're all in one area even better.\n\nOn the day of the move: Wolf pack moving was punctual, efficient, and their service was exceptional!

{"region":"WEST","text":"Campo is a great new-ish place in downtown Reno. Classes up the Riverwalk a bit. I went once just for drinks, and the bar was out of the raspberry beer I wanted, so the bartender created one for me using Anchor Steam and raspberry Italian soda syrup.\n\nAs for the food, I first ordered the risotto, which was grotesque, but I don't entirely blame Campo, because I think risotto might just be a horrible dish. The gnocchi, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious.\n\nWe tried the fritto misto for an appetizer, and that was crunchy and delicious, and I just love aioli.\n\nCampo serves absinthe and really makes a big display of it, with an entire water cooler upon your table so you can properly drizzle the sugar through your absinthe spoon.\n\nBut the best thing about Campo is the dessert -- the caramel budino is fantastic, albeit tiny. But, man, every spoonful is like tasting heaven. It's amazing.\n\nAnyway, the place is crowded, so you definitely need to make a reservation. And it closes a bit earlier than other places, so keep that in mind when reservation-making. Plus, it's really quite expensive.","stars":3}

{"region":"WEST","text":"This review is written for the educated seafood eater.\nThere is only ONE reason to come to this restaurant: the view of the harbor. It's the best in Santa Barbara. I mean do you really need to look any further than at the picture of the shrimp and scallop linguine covered in melted cheese? That tells you everything you need to know about the food so if you're disappointed shame on you. And please don't buy into any blah blah about \"local seafood from fishing boats....\" I asked the chef and he said there are 2 fish that are local on the menu and they are so smothered in ingredients you may as well be eating frozen Alabama catfish. They should be ashamed of themselves. It's inconceivable, as this area has an incredible selection of shellfish and fish. \nSo, if you want to have a nice drink from friendly bartenders and look at the gorgeous view of a beautiful harbor and mountains, this is definitely your place, but if you want to sample the world class seafood available in this region (live Spot Prawns, Sea Urchin, etc) stay far away.","stars":3}

But this isn't the first time they've made me feel uncomfortable. My first visit it was a petite white women with dark brown hair. Asking me same question even though she was right behind me every aisle. My recent visit it seems there has been talk. I had returned a perfume that was over $100 but literally smelled like alcohol. So I returned it. This time I enter Ulta, a short white male with dark hair and an open button up continues to ask me questions AFTER another employee already greeted and filled me in on store sale etc. He comes off as the \"helpful sales guy\" but I was literally watching him switch from each side of the room to watch me everywhere I went. I went by the skincare, he was suddenly reorganizing by the skincare lines. I go to look at face powder he is ALSO fake organizing the powder. Then I'm finally by the perfumes. The little man really thought I wasn't gonna pick up on him standing two aisles over (the aisles are 3-4 ft tall)  PRETENDING TO STARE OFF INTO THE DISTANCE  Immediately I look up at him to call him over and he starts questioning if I \"really liked\" the perfume I got this time. Like sir? Is this gossip girl or an establishment? Now ironically enough Of course I didn't say anything when I watched a white couple in front of me in the checkout line shove a bunch of foundation concealer n blushes etc in their coat sleeves because lol not my job!

{"region":"WEST","text":"I had an appointment with Dr. Kenly, and I have to say I was happy that he spent more than the usual few minutes I usually receive from physicians. \nNot once did I feel like he was trying to get me out the door so he could move on to his next patient. However, I didn't find the diagnostics process that great. He reviewed the scans I had done, and said their wasn't much he could do for me  except use medications or injections, but I had to wait until November to have any more procedures done. \n\nI was really hoping he would examine my neck instead of only referring to the scans I had done, but I guess pain management doctors don't do that. ? Seems weird to me as their are many reasons why someone might be experiencing pain. So I left feeling hopeless, and continued to suffer with pain. Finally, unable to cope with my pain, I went to a physiatrist, who ordered X-rays, which showed that I was lacking mobility in my upper neck. Since then I have been doing physical therapy with a therapist who specializes in the spine, which has revealed where my neck is extremely weak, and what muscles are taking over that shouldn't. I am slowly correcting the weaknesses in my neck, and I still have pain, but instead of it being 8-9-10 level pain, it is 5-6 level pain. \nNo injection or medication is going to correct this muscular imbalance. Although Dr. Kenly spent a lengthy amount of time with me, I wish the time had been spent correctly diagnosing me. \nThe two stars are for his spending time with me, instead of the lousy few minutes I have been getting from other physicians.","stars":2}

{"region":"WEST","text":"Never ever thought I would put seafood and elegance in the same name. Welp this place did it for me. The design of the place is extravagant. The color combinations the ceiling, the chair color and booths everything screams elegance. \n\nThe details of some walls being brick some being white wood and industrial yellow lights are just superb to the environment. \n\nI was completely not expecting this type of environment  the waiter we had was Cooper really nice young man with great energy and honest opinions he helped guide me threw the menu and instructed me to go with the sweat potato fries. \n\nTHE SOURDOUGH IS THE BEST I EVER HAD IN THE ENTIRE WORLD AND YES ALL CAPS WAS NEEDED. Most sourdough is completely hard damn near tooth breaking which makes you mostly pull the dough from the middle and eat. But this is different it's a thin layer of crust on top that gives you a nice crunch but allows you to bite through pleasantly enjoying the delicious bread and butter that makes you want to forget about the food and just eat bread. \n\nThe crab cakes had one hell of a sauce that I actually dipped everything in. The veggies are farm to table and when I say you can taste the difference you'll never want to go back again. The freshness of the corn was a different level and exceeded all expectations .\n\nThe fried jumbo shrimp were perfectly battered and fries to perfection. I literally can't say anything bad about them, dip them in my crab cake sauce and man you got yourself something special. \n\nThe lobster roll was the first I've ever seen were they look like they put some love and effort into the lobster and of course make it hot you just can't eat those things cold. Drip the butter on it and allow it to soak up all that goodness. The crunchy bite of the roll plus, butter and sweet lobster was divine and they don't skimp on the lobster at all. \n\nMy experience was Devine and the food was excellent.","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"I've been taking my kids here for years, its a pretty good practice.  The doctors are attentive and do spend a lot of time with the patients. I've never had to use them for anything too complicated though, just well-child, vaccines and the occasional cold.  They are good about getting you in to see someone quickly, when the need is urgent and your child's regular Dr is booked.\n\nThey are usually running late.  You might be call back for a vitals check within 15 mins of your appointment time, but I've sat in the room with my kids for up to an hour waiting for the Dr.  Expect to be actually seen by the Dr 45-60 mins after your appointment time.  \n\nFront office staff are often aloof.  They immediately get to work on making sure they have your insurance and co-payment.  The paperwork is a bit much.  They are rather adamant that you to fill out a rather long history form when you check in. Half of the time the Dr or assistants don't even collect it or look at it.\n\nOverall, great doctors, my kids love them. Be prepared to be treated like a paying customer out front (e.g. payment and billing info is top priority, fill out those forms, fees for being late or canceling appointments) but then all expectations you might have as a customer don't apply to the medical staff (on-time or quick service or even an acknowledgment from the staff and Drs that lateness might cause problems for the patients).","stars":3}

{"region":"WEST","text":"Was offered a coupon on Restaurant.com. Looked at the on-line menu, which seemed pretty good, so decided to try it out and take my Mom and BestFriend for a ladies-lunch-out. The temp outside was in the high 90's, but there was no a\/c in the restaurant, although there are numerous ceiling fans, but the inside temp was still pretty warm. Also there are no booths, which my partially disabled mother prefers for her comfort. We arrived at noon and were the only customers. We were seated, but not really greeted, by a young, slightly built, dark-haired man whose name we were not told, nor was he wearing a name badge. He asked if we would like water, which we did, and he brought us cool, not cold, water with no ice. He then gave us the lunch menus, which were NOTHING like the on-line menus, that have multiple sandwich and salad choices for $9. THIS menu lists your choice of a meat (chicken, prawns, tuna, mahi-mahi, swordfish) atop your choice of either a variety of salads, aioli pasta, or vegetable. OR you can choose a meat on bread with \"potatoes\" which turned out to be fries. All of these are $12. The same young man, who it turned out was the only employee on the floor, came to see if we were ready to order. I told him that this menu was nothing like the one I had seen on-line, and he said that yeah, they needed to update it. We ordered drinks while we were still studying the menu. He was also the bartender. My BF ordered a Heineken, Mom a gin on the rocks, and I a Blue Moon. He came back with my Blue Moon in a bottle. I had to ask for a glass and an orange slice. He told my BF that sorry, they were out of Heineken, so she made another choice. He brought Mom's gin on the rocks in a martini glass, when it should have been in a rocks glass. OK, so he is no bartender. BF then ordered the prawns on aioli pasta, Mom chose a chicken sandwich, I ordered prawns on a citrus salad, which listed mixed greens with orange, pineapple, and coconut. I LOVE coconut, so was looking forward to it. While we waited, 4 men came in to drink at the bar, and two to have lunch. No one else came in while we were there, and it was the noon lunch hour. The food came and was dropped off. Mom enjoyed her sandwich. BF liked her pasta. My salad had NO coconut, the oranges had not been de-seeded, and the pineapple was spears from the hard core, not the fruit, of the pineapple. The dressing was tasty, however. I waited for our server to come back to see how everything was, but since he was the only employee on the floor, he was busy with the men, and didn't come back to check on us. I would have asked for the coconut and some edible pieces of pineapple, but was never given the opportunity. The prawns were good, but there were a total of only 4 served on both my salad and BF's pasta. By the time the server finally came back to check on us, BF had just about cleaned her plate, Mom was still eating her sandwich, and I had eaten my prawns, orange slices, and some of the greens. I told him that the salad was a disappointment and why it was. He only said \"Oh\". No apology, no offer to rectify the problem, and as we found out later, no adjustment on the bill. Mom decided later that she could not finish her sandwich and wanted to take the rest home. I had to get up and ask our server for a go-box. We still left a 20% tip based on the full amount before the coupon, but only because we felt a little sorry for the guy and his obvious inexperience. I left totally unsatisfied and HUNGRY! Will not be going back or recommending this place to anyone.","stars":2}

However, our last two visits have been absolutely awful from a service standpoint. \n\nWhen we recently sat at the bar, there were two sushi chefs, one cook in the kitchen, one hostess, and two servers. Including us, there were 9 customers in the entire restaurant at 12:30pm. It took a good five minutes for the sushi chef to even acknowledge us. It took another 15 minutes between the time we orders some simple rolls to the time they were actually delivered. Each time we ordered a new roll, the same delay occurred. Maybe they were understaffed from a chef perspective, but not a single person even acknowledged the wait time, let alone apologized for it. \n\nIn another instance where we sat at a table, we were getting to the end of our meal when one (of 4) of our group members ordered two more rolls. The rolls never came out but the check did. We asked the server for the last two rolls and she insisted that they were already delivered to us. Two problems here: 1, they were not. 2, even if they had been, it's AYCE sushi... bring two more rolls and move on!  Instead, she continued to insist that the rolls were delivered.

{"region":"WEST","text":"I think this hotel is great for an overnight or weekend getaway. I arrived right at check in time and was greeted by friendly valet staff. The people working the day shift on the desk were a bit less friendly than the valet staff but still helpful. \n\nCheck in was quick and easy. I was placed in a room that's in a second building with no view of anything worth looking at. I was only there for the night so I didn't make a huge fuss about it. \n\nThe reason the review is only 4 stars is solely due to the quality of the room. There were ants in the bathroom which no one wants to see in their room. We also woke up to a spider crawling across the wall. I noticed that when I look at the door it wasn't sealed well at the bottom and that's likely part of the reason there were critters in the room. Also, this is small pet peeve of mine but a thing I don't expect to be changed, the bathroom lights are outside the bathroom door and on the opposite side from where the door opens. The placement is just odd. My final gripe is that the WiFi was slow. \n\nI happened to lock myself out of room and while waiting for new keys and ride back, Rebecca was very nice and friendly. She not only asked us about our evening and gave additional suggestions, but she offered additional toiletries and gave us snacks as we waited near the fire place. She's really a great team member, the kind of person you want to\nbe greeted by. All of the valet staff we encountered were nice and worked quickly whenever a request was made. I really appreciated them having a golf cart to shuttle us between their buildings.","stars":4}
{"region":"WEST","text":"I recently moved to Reno and left all my glass back in California but had been to honeycomb before while in Reno in vacation. So began my hunt for any smoke shop in Reno that carried illadelph. \n\nThis took me to a majority of the higher end smoke shops in town looking for anyone who might carry one. Through my search I found a total of 1 illadelph in all of Reno (an outrageously priced micro beaker at art Dogs Grace). But after visiting so many shops I can hands down say honeycomb is the best. After I gave up looking for an illadelph the owner not only helped me out finding what I was looking for in his stock but matched the online price! Pretty impressive for a smoke shop. \n\nSince that purchase I NEVER buy glass anywhere else. honeycomb has the one of the best selection (art dogs has higher end glass, but as earlier mentioned outrageously priced) and best prices. Not to mention the staff is by far better than all other smoke shops around here!","stars":5}
{"region":"WEST","text":"Where to begin.  Let me begin with the positives:  Pretty good fries, large variety of burgers, one of my favorite beers available (although, it was in a can).  I also applaud that Diablo Burger is using local ingredients in their dishes. \n\nNow on to the negatives.  There is a two paragraph explanation on their menu about how they cook all burgers medium, unless you really, really, really want it done another way.  Well, I can't stand undercooked hamburger, and consented to medium-well, because I was assured there would be just a hint on pink.  If that was medium-well, I would hate to see medium.  Way too rare for me!  And as mentioned in a previous review, because the meat is so lean, it doesn't have much flavor.  Luckily the produce and condiments were delicious.  The buns were a little harder than usual, but I think they have to be, to hold up to that huge chunk of meat.  \n\nThe interior of the place is actually pretty sterile and uninviting.  I think a burger joint should be more comfortable.  We sat at the bar on stools that used metal tractor seats.  They were neat to look at, but had four big bolts that dug into my ass the entire time I was there.  The bar had no draft beers, only cans, and when I asked for a cold glass, I was told they didn't have any.  And even though they have only been open for a week, our server acted like she was already bored with working there.  \n\nAs we were driving home, my husband pointed out that we were only a half mile or so from Lindy's on 4th.  I think that's where we'll go for our burger next time.  So why am I giving Diablo Burger 3 stars instead of 2?  See paragraph 1.","stars":3}

On the way back to California, maybe 2 hours later, I received a call that the mechanic did not put an oil filter in the car.  What??????????  The vehicle was being driven without an oil filter for 2 hours???  Yes, that's exactly what the service department guy told me.  I'll leave his name out because well, he was actually concerned.  \n\nI was told to pull over immediately.  So, the car was taken to a different Toyota in Vacaville.  Upon arriving, we asked the service rep to let us know if there really wasn't an oil filter in the car.  First of all, I didn't even know that was possible.  Wouldn't the oil dump everywhere?  After checking, they found that yes, the Toyota in Reno let us drive away without an oil filter.  Wow.  I also learned that there is some sort of seal in newer cars to prevent leakage.  Thank goodness.\n\nI had to pay for the oil change in Vacaville and get reimbursed in Reno.  When I went back to Dolan, my service guy was on lunch.  Instead, I was directed to the assistant supervisor.  He had absolutely no idea what I was talking about.  Anyhow, I put in my request for a refund.  \n\nI am really bummed about this incident.  With a family of Toyota vehicles, I am now scared to bring our cars here for maintenance.

{"region":"WEST","text":"A few friends and I came here to get a drink before dinner. When we checked in with the hostess, and told her that we were just coming for drinks, she asked us if we could \"do her a big favor\" and order our drinks at the bar, and then she would hold a table for us outside. We waited at the bar for over 10 minutes, and the bartender didn't look at us once. He checked in with the patrons on either side of us, and even when we said \"excuse me\" well within earshot, he did not acknowledge us. At this point, we saw the hostess seating people at the table she had \"reserved\" for us. When we asked her about it, her response was that the people had made reservations for inside seating, but had changed their minds at the last minute. She did not apologize for this, or for not finding us to let us know. She had made no move to come over and inform us that we no longer had a table saved. At that point, almost 20 minutes since we had first checked in with her, she told us that there was a bar upstairs with seats available. When we went upstairs, we found another bar, but it was completely full as well. At that point, we just left. The hostess did not even look up as we walked by. This is by far some of the worst customer service I have ever had at a restaurant, and I will not be returning. The owner of this restaurant should really do a better job at hiring staff that knows how to treat their customers.","stars":1}

{"region":"WEST","text":"On September 22nd my family and I were leaving Topaz Lake campground when our truck broke down with our 5th wheel attached.  We called for a tow truck to come help us. Greg who was our driver came to the rescue, little to our knowledge that this trip back home to Sparks would turn into a  disaster 7 hours later. This journey I'm about to share with you is a little long, however.. much needed to truly understand what this company did for us.... we proceeded to leave the area with intentions of getting our 3 dogs (riding in the cab of the truck) and ourselves home. Greg made sure everything was strapped down,  safe to tow, and was cautious at every movement.  We get into the Damonte ranch area (south end of town) and suddenly things shifted, the front end of our truck which was hooked up to the tow truck slipped to one side. We pulled over and waited for Greg to detach everything and re-attach. Started on our way again,  we get about a mile away from Pyramid Hwy and wouldn't you know it, our back tire on our truck gave out completely.  No, I mean the entire tire blew right off and we're rolling on the rim literally! We pull over to fix that, this is now a 7 hour adventure.  The General manager has been contacted at this point when Greg reported this to him.  We got home safely in 1 piece.  Upon arrival,  Micheal (General manager) called us to make sure we were all ok.. the very next morning,  I was again contacted by Michael who was very concerned about our well being as well as the damages to our truck during this whole ordeal. Silver State Towing went WAY beyond the call of duty to make things right,  right away our truck was towed once again straight down to the shop. Michael was so kind enough to get our vehicle repaired. He even took care of what was wrong with our truck to cause it to break down in the first place (water pump). Which by the way was NOT his responsibility. He replaced everything and more that had gone wrong with the truck. He even went to my husband's work to replace the tire and rim. I cannot even begin to tell you the heart and hospitality that went into Silver State Towing to come out to my house on their own free will, to move my 5th wheel into the side of my house because it was in violation of the HOA rules. Not only did Michael come himself, bit he also brought Greg too! We were so blessed by this company in so many ways,  I want to personally say, THANK YOU. Everyone down at Silver State Towing you are more than a company,  you really do care about people. Thank you for everything you have done for my family,  thank you for standing behind everything you believe in. We appreciate everything that you have done.  Our hearts are so grateful, I wouldn't want to use any other service, because we would have been treated like a number. May God prosper you all, and over take you with his mercy and blessings abundantly. If you need someone to trust with your lives,  vehicle and simply create a beautiful relationship.

The pizza was great although they could bake the pizza a bit longer to crisp it up, but that's just a personal preference I suppose. We noticed a very young crew and didn't think the service would be great, but we were immediately proven wrong when we were greeted by a young lady named Jay. She was very sweet and smiled the entire time explaining the whole process even though she was busy she didn't rush us, and even found time to smile and joke with us asking \"why did we wait so long to try it\"? After we told her it was our first time in. Then we made our way down the line to a few more people and were a little less thrilled with the hum drum bored attitudes UNTIL we reached the register and were greeted by another ray of sunshine named Sky. She greeted us by name, which I gather she got from the writing on the paper for our pizza. She was peppy and friendly and thanked us for coming in rather than just ringing us up and sending us on our way. Now to the dining room. I suppose they deserve a little slack since they were slammed busy, but they definitely needed to come out and tidy up a bit and stock the napkins and other things.

It feels like half the store is wine\/beer, a good quarter is cheeses, and the rest is just miscellaneous high-end odds and ends (note: this is a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the idea). The real gem here, though, is the food counter. You can order incredible sandwiches made-to-order, or get pre-prepared options like various kinds of pasta salad, soups, or green salads. They also have one of the best desserts and pastries in town for very reasonable prices! Everything is so fresh and tastes incredibly gourmet! It's also a great option for ordering birthday or special occasion cakes.

They do offer a tart frozen yogurt flavor though - and have plenty of toppings for it as well.\n\nI - as so many others in SB - was introduced to McConnell's ice cream at the Camino Real marketplace in Goleta.  This was very unfortunate because I had thought the Mission store was equally as terrible.  Turns out, they are owned independently - and it REALLY shows.  Portion size, selection, enthusiasm, atmosphere are all excellent at the Mission store.  I met the owner one evening before closing - we chatted for a good 15-20 minutes and he was eager to give us a tour of his workshop - where he creates a lot of the flavors of frozen yogurt himself!  \n\nWhen I am presented with such a friendly staff and the owner who is eager to listen and please, it makes me feel giving a 5 star rating is a must.\n\nThe difference between McConnell's in Goleta and McConnell's on Mission is night and day - something that has made me a loyal and very repeat customer to the Mission store.

Was excited to try this place as I am a fan of El Paisano, and big fan of all ethnic and exotic cuisines. \n\nWent to the counter to order, took a couple of minutes for the man working (possibly owner) to finish up an order or payment or something. After all that waiting he told us to take a seat (could have easily pardoned himself while we waited?)\n\nHe brings menus over but not promptly, takes his time. We are both professionally dressed, and anyone w\/ a limited amount of intelligence, might assume we are on our lunch hour, especially me w\/ my Wells Fargo name tag. \n\nAfter he brings the menus over, I ask what are the top dishes as I often do as new restaurants, so I don't need to have a bad meal, complain, and give a bad review. He explains his top three, asks us for drinks, I say none, my co-workers, orders one. \n\nA couple of more tables arrive, and he proceeds to help every table before even bringing back our drink order, little lone, take our order. It's been about 14 minutes since we arrived, and I can already tell we are not going to make it back in time as there will be at least 3-4 orders ahead of us to cook, since he VIP'd everyone who arrived after us. \n\nHe also didn't have a sense of urgency and no hustle. As I learned in my martial arts training the best way to avoid a bad situation is to exit before it arrives, so we did! \n\nWe left, without receiving the drink order, nor was he even  close to taking our lunch order, as we exited, he didn't say a word. Our orders were going to be pricey too, we were both looking at spending about $15 each, plus his drink. I will most likely never visit this place again, but what was strange was I had a good vibe walking in and was excited to try this place. Also working down the street it could have easily become a weekly spot for me if I liked the food. \n\nA smart business owner or even an employee, would have made some recommendations at the counter, taken our drink order, and most likely our lunch order, and had us sit down. \n\nUnfortunately we weren't dealing w\/ intelligence or someone who can think on their feet. I also got a few unwelcome looks from the arriving patrons, like what are you DOING in OUR PLACE, like it wasn't Gringo friendly. I really find this kind of stuff odd and laughable, when I am in my own country. \n\nMy next review is the place we ended up at and got served immediately, since we were already over 20 minutes into a 1 hour time time window.","stars":1}

{"region":"WEST","text":"On the positive side, I was able to get my car into Christensen Auto sooner than the dealership with a check engine light. Secondly, they did replace the part, and so my issue is resolved.\nMy experience with Christensen Auto did not live up to the wonderful heartwarming commercial. If this is how you were treated by your mom or vise versa, then your family is in trouble. Your word should be your bond. I was told that I would have my car back that afternoon, untrue. Although you work on all makes of vehicles, the catch is, you do not carry the parts which in my case took an additional day. Through the dealership, I would have received a lifetime warranty on the part as well. Price-wise you cost the exact same as the dealership for parts and labor upfront. No savings there. If I had gone to the dealership which I totally regret in hindsight, my overall experience would have been positive. At the dealership, I would have been greeted by a happy customer service technician instead of a burned-out employee who scowled in the morning and was still scowling the next afternoon.  I would have been able to take a FREE round-trip shuttle to work and pick up and if the service ran over a day than I would have received a Free rental. Instead, I paid 79.00 in Uber fees in two days, the inconvenience of being locked out of my house because you had my garage remote and the lack of my independence. When I asked the serviceman why they do not offer Uber or shuttle service he told me it was due to growing pains. The pain was mine, to my pocketbook, however.  No senior discount either. At the dealership, I would have received a 10% discount and my car would have received a deluxe vehicle cleaning as well. That means you cost me more in the long run than the dealership by 60.00 for discounts and 79.00 in Uber fees. That is a total of 139.00 over a dealership, no car wash, and unpleasant customer service. You would treat your mother like that? Truly sad false emotionally driven advertising.","stars":1}

{"region":"WEST","text":"I went here for 7+ (almost 8) years. In the beginning it was okay, but the last 2 years especially have been bad-- rude and unprofessional staff for example.\nI can put up with rudeness and unprofessionalism for a while, but when my health can be compromised, I'm done. \n\nThe following reasons are why I am finally leaving this place after putting up with it for 2 years. Reasons # 1 and 2 are the straws that finally broke the camel's back. \n\n\n1.  This is NASTY and super bad.  One of the women who gives allergy shots touched my blood with her fingertip. She was NOT wearing gloves nor did she use cotton balls or alcohol swabs.  She wiped my blood away with her bare fingertip.\n\nBEWARE.  You can transmit disease this way.\n\n\n2.  I complained to the office manager who said she'd \"talk\" to the employees about this.  \n \nA few months later the same woman touched me with her bare hands AGAIN- Right by where she'd just given me the injections.\n\n(Reasons 1 and 2 are the main reasons I've decided to leave.)\n\n\n3. One of the doctors made a bunch of inappropriate, rude, racist, nasty comments to me the last time I met with him for a basic general follow up appointment. I didn't know how to respond to what he was saying but got really upset when I came home and processed what he'd said.  \n\n\n4. I take my health seriously and a couple of times when I've asked questions, I've been met by silence, or the staff have given me looks like the questions I asked were incredibly stupid, or more recently, Judy, the office manager, laughed out loud at one of my questions like it was the most ridiculous thing she'd heard. She laughed at me in front of everyone else.\n\nReally?\n\nI wasn't joking when I was asking questions about my health-- it's not funny. If I knew the answer, I wouldn't have asked the question.  I didn't realize it was such a big deal to ask questions. Her response was rude, unprofessional, and inappropriate. Patients should be able to ask questions to get information and clarity regarding their health without getting laughed at. Being treated with some respect and courtesy might be nice. \n\nBtw, the question I asked turned out to be very legitimate. Judy laughed at me and the FNP told me my sympton wasn't a result of the meds I was on. However, my new doctor told me that my sympton is in fact a side effect of the medicine I was put on. So in addition to being rude and unprofessional, they are incompetent too and don't know the side effects of the meds they prescribe, and instead of taking the patient's complaint seriously, just laugh at them in front of everyone.  \nYeah-- NOT good.\n\n\n5. They don't seem to know what patient privacy is. When I've asked to speak to the FNP or have her call me, the people at the front desk keep telling me to just ask them the question right there in front of everyone. Even when I stated a couple of times I'd prefer to talk to her on the phone, both the receptionist and Office Manager's responses were, \"She's right here, just ask her now.\" They didn't understand I wanted to speak to her PRIVATELY.\n\nSo I was forced to ask personal health questions in front of 4 people at the front desk as well as all the patients sitting in the waiting area who can overhear everything I'm saying because there's no privacy, even though it's a personal matter-- a very embarrassing situation-- and then Judy, the office manager, laughed out loud at my question.  What the heck?\n\nFor people who are in the health field, they should know what \"Patient Privacy\" is and be sensitive to patients' needs-- not laugh at them for asking a legitimate question. \n\n\n6. A lot of the staff are rude and\/ or unprofessional. The nurses act like they are bothered that they have to help the patients (at least with me).\n\nI don't appreciate being treated in such a non-professional, patronizing, rude manner, or being put at risk for spread of disease because they are unhygienic and touch patients' blood with no protection!\n\nI do NOT recommend these guys.

But that's not the shocker here, we ordered some drinks, and I went to sip mine, and what I thought was ice, was GLASS! The staff was very apologetic, but what makes me not want to come back, is the fact that the manager didn't even comp my drink or anything!

{"region":"WEST","text":"definitely \"The Worst\" restaurant I have ever been to. The quality of the food was bad and the portions were too small. Avg. price of one meal was around 25 bucks with only one entree and tortillas. The owner was so rude, when I complained that a black spider is roaming around on the beds on the floor, he started arguing and fighting with all of us. He even told us that he don't like Indian people coming into his restaurant and we were lucky that we could come to his restaurant. Awfully bad service as there was only one waiter and he doesn't even understand Indian dish names that were listed on the menu. I think if somebody just wanna go see the decor then its a nice place to go but that's all it got.","stars":1}

{"region":"WEST","text":"I'm just like my Dad - I judge a home improvement project's complexity on the number of Home Depot trips you had to make to finish it. One trip = easy, peasy. 4+ trips = difficult. I've had a handful of projects of all difficulties and to say I frequent Home Depot is an understatement. \n\nI usually find what I need fairly quickly, but on the chance that I don't know where something is, someone can usually point you in the right direction or find someone that does know. I also like that it's super close to my house which is great when that difficult project keeps increasing the number of Home Depot trips. Also, I love that they allow dogs (this might be all Home Depots). I like to bring my dog places just to get him out and about and not just on his normal walk. All the employees light up when they see a dog walking through.\n\nI've had a couple of gripes with Home Depot though: \n1) The time we just wanted a gallon of paint. We waited at the paint desk for about 5 minutes, but no one was around or came up to help us. We had customer service call for the person who was working paint. Another 5 minutes, no one showed up. Customer Service called gain. 5 more minutes and still no one. Finally, someone who hardly ever works paint came to help us and was very apologetic about the wait and that whoever was supposed to be working the desk never showed up. This guy was so friendly and even gave us a 10% discount on our purchase. This is the only time we've ever had an issue with paint - there is normally somebody there ready to help you out.\n2) They make keys, but don't expect anything fancy. We have a U-Haul brand padlock on our side fence and I wanted to get a key made for parents and brother. But they didn't have the key to match. \n3) Sprinkler parts are kind of lacking. It seems like they have a lot, but there's always some joint or head that we need that they don't have.","stars":4}

{"region":"WEST","text":"This place is largely populated by meat wads and sorority girls, but it's got great facilities.  The machines and weights are plentiful, they are always kept in a state of excellent repair, the pool is perfect, and the locker room area is clean and decidedly non-fungusy.  Those things alone make it worth the price of admission.\n\nI do, however, think it blows that joining a gym is such a strange balancing act.  I used to be a Golds member.  The people were friendly, there was a decidedly neighborhood vibe to the place, and the prices were reasonable.  That said, their facilities were the absolute pits.\n\nLA Fitness has amazing facilities, but the customer service sucks, and there is a decidedly aggressive, pushy attitude among most of the people who work out there. Between the douche patrols taking time away from injecting bovine growth hormone into their scrota to lounge around, taking up three or four machines while they take phone calls, to the girls who will stand in front of you while you're on the elliptical, sucking their teeth and sighing loudly until you yield the machine, LA Fitness is far from the friendliest place on earth.\n\nThe customer service people are also glorified used car salesmen in wicking athletic gear.  You and another person might sign up for a gym membership within minutes of each other, and the other person might pay half the initiation fee you did and have ten bucks knocked off his monthly fee.  Their printed prices mean precisely jack and shit, and they are always trying to hustle you.\n\nPersonal training packages here are the province of the rich and idiotic.  They come with big initiation fees, monthly contracts, and some of the heftiest rates in town.  Plus, the guys who try to sell you on them use high pressure, dick tactics and a combination of shame and guilt to get you to sign up.  They also make ludicrous, unobtainable promises about the kind of fitness you can hope to achieve and do everything they can to make you believe that you are too hapless to be able to make any substantive progress on your own.\n\nSo, all of that said, why am I still giving three stars?  I don't need personal training, and I don't go to the gym to make friends.  I go, put my iPod on, keep my head down, and do what I need to do.  In that respect, LA Fitness is just fine.

We showed up at 3:30PM after driving 3 hours from Temecula. There was no desk clerk in the lobby, so we stood around for a couple mins until she came down. First thing she says, without saying hi or welcome, was check in is at 4PM, but if you want you can pay $15 to check in now. $15 for 25 mins??? No, that's not happening. So I said that's fine we will come back in 20 mins....then at check out time, which is 11AM, the desk clerk knocked on our door letting us know check out is 11AM. I said no problem we will be out in 5 mins, just need to use the restroom first. We head down to the lobby 5 mins later and check out. We walk out and review our bill and notice they charged $5 for late check out. For literally 10 mins. I walk back in and mention the late charge and how this is not how you provide customer service. She would not remove the charge and mentioned how it's in their brochure. Yes, we all know check out time.

My range of motion after a massage always amazes me, and the stretches I can do at home help keep the pain from returning. \n\nAfter one of my massages Lee Ann mentioned that my insurance will cover acupuncture, and that I should try it. I politely said no, thinking of the iconic movie scene with hundreds of needles being stuck in every inch of exposed skin. They reassured me that only a few needles per session would be used, and even brought a needle out for me to see and feel. The needle was thin and flexible, and they told me if I was uncomfortable that they would stop. I thought it was worth a shot and booked an appointment. \n\nCandice is absolutely amazing! She's extremely attentive to what is going on in my life, and treats according to things we chat about when I arrive. (ie stress, allergies, colds, etc) Plus she's super fun! I am absolutely in love with acupuncture. I can feel my heart rate slow, and my body relax after the first few needles go in. It helps improve both my mood and health. It's sometimes the best sleep I get!\n\nIf you are on the fence about massage or acupuncture, just go in for 1 appointment. It is well worth it, and you will be just as addicted as I am.

My own wedding was on 8\/10\/17 and I went to Joyce to work on my dress that I bought off the rack that was about 4 sizes too big and very long. On top of that it was a very delicate chantilly lace dress so I didn't want to take it to just anyone. She went above and beyond in altering my dress! The length was perfect, the fit was like a glove, and she paid the utmost attention to making sure every detail was perfect. I felt so beautiful on my wedding day. Thank you, Joyce!!!","stars":5}

Which the menu should have said \"Chicken is smothered with mustard\" \nThe server checked on me and I said I didn't like the sandwich. She didn't offer to make a new one, or anything. \nI also work in the food industry and whatever we can do we make the customer happy.

And nothing was done about it was very disappointing.\nCustomer service is everything when you have a business. And you two \"chicks\" should know and should teach your people a thing or two about customer service. \nWould you rather make one new sandwich and gain a happy customer? \nOr would you rather lose a customer and have her write a bad yelp review? \nPick your battles. \nReno is a small city and Yelp is a big app.","stars":3}

{"region":"WEST","text":"DO NOT BUY A VEHICLE FROM THIS ESTABLISHMENT UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF!!! If I could give them ZERO stars that would be far more accurate.\n\nThis sorry excuse for a business completely obliterated my credit since I was a young and naive 18 year old, and they truly did not care.  I was told when applying to include my own income along with my boyfriend's so I would have enough of a monthly income to be approved.  My boyfriend at the time was not a co-applicant, and now I know from my experience in finance that this is completely illegal.  Therefore, I did not make enough money to support the request and they illegally filed my application with exaggerated income in order to get it approved.  Needless to say, the car was reposessed within a year.  The way that these disgusting people took advantage of me as a young, vibrant, excited young girl buying her first car makes me absolutely sick to my stomach.\n\nLast but not least, they sold me a vehicle with a nail stuck in the tire, and it took an act of God to get them to reimburse me the $15 it cost to fix it.  \n\nThese people are shady, greedy, inhumane, dishonest, cocky, revolting liars.... and that's a conservative description.  Read the other reviews and you'll see that I'm not the only one who feels this way BY FAR... these people truly are the scum of the dealership earth.  Notice that the one positive review is only from one month ago... I promise you, give it time and they will be feeling much, much different.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want to buy a car with endless defects, unwillingly ruin your credit, and be taken advantage of, this is your place.  If this isn't what you want, go ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE.\n\nIn light of a comment I received, please do not message me if you wish to tell me this was my fault and I needed to \"take responsibility\".  I ended up settling the matter and paying what I owed.  Yes, being 18 and naive does not completely exonerate me, however it does prove the manipulative and shady tactics that this place will use to sell a car.","stars":1}

I understand that there are four possible choices from each tap.  \nBut the real killer for me was the temperature.  I had my winter coat on and I was still uncomfortably cold.

My only gripe with them is their propensity for up-selling, something that tends to mark the automotive repair\/service industry as a whole, and is not altogether unexpected at this point. While my old car might possibly benefit from receiving the services they recommended (IE, Engine Flush, Transmission Flush, High-Mileage Oil Change), a second opinion from a highly-qualified mechanic revealed that the services recommended for my car were not, in fact, nearly as important to get as I was led to believe.\n\nTo consumers: Jiffy Lube is excellent for many reasons... but know what you're getting into before you go...

I took a class with Megan yesterday and she was so energetic and gave great direction on alignment. I'd definitely recommend classes with her. The unlimited membership allows you to take as many classes you would like a month. There is enough variety and the instructors mix up routines each class. Jenna at the front desk was so helpful and answered all my questions and I had lots. There is a great app for your phone that makes booking a breeze and you can add your upcoming classes to you phone's calendar. It's only been a few days but I can feel the difference. I have so much more energy. Check them out.","stars":5}

If you're looking for a place that serves food with amazing flavor, employs the best in the service industry and offers ingredients you'd think you can only find in Italy, then this is your place.\n\nThere are about 12 tables in the whole place so it allows for service to be more personal. My husband and I both ordered beer and shared the pork belly to start. Might I say that it was the best pig anything I've ever had. So much flavor, texture and happiness on one plate. I had planned to order pasta, but after talking with our waiter I had to try the pizza and so did the hubby. So I got the G3 (mushrooms, prosciutto, onion, basil, mozzarella, garlic and a fried egg) and he got meat lovers (best part was the in-house made sausage!). We order pizza from somewhere weekly. THIS. IS. THE. BEST. pizza in town! Made with imported Italian Flour, fresh ingredients and piping hot! I wish I could afford to eat it every week. $24 for a 12\" pizza. \n\nWe normally share dessert but had to try more. So I ordered the tiramisu and he got a chocolate mouse with toasted marshmallow.

We stayed at this hotel and definitely it was overpriced ($285) for the room but considering it was booked last minute, it wasn't too bad. Frank was very friendly and we enjoyed his customer service and hospitality. Great location and walking distance to beach. Free wifi which was good since we ended up watching Sideways online at night to get into winetasting mode. Rooms were surprisingly cleaner than I expected. Room is old vintage decor but looks like they renovated the room with new sinks and showers. It was a comfortable stay. The breakfast was better than I expected for continental breakfast. Overall we enjoyed our stay.","stars":3}

My friend and I traveled a combined 10 hours that day just to try it, but it is no more.  \n\nGood:  The meal I did have was arguably the most ecstatic experience in my entire life.   Apologies to friends, lovers, chemists, parents, other restaurateurs, and anyone else who ever tried to make my day, but you just never did it for me like this.\n\nUseful (now that all of the flattering cliches have been dispensed with):  Everything is amazing.  The newly-revised-to-be-more-local menu is for real-- really damn good.   \n\nA definite hippie ethic is manifested and it's the good part of that scene.  There's a focus on freshness, rejection of needless convention (no extra spoons, little plates, finger bowls, hovering water-waiters or any such nonsense), emphasis on nutrition, and contrast.  The beef selections we tried also showcased local plumbs and figs, for instance.  You have not eaten beef until you've had mignon tartared with figs the way they do it.  Yet, this is above all else a classy joint; no signs of sloppy stonerism or militant vegans here.  Double yet, one can go vegetarian here without question or drama.   One would miss out on the tartar, some amazing meat stocks, and the lamb pate that way so live up to your omnivorous potential and do it right.  \n\nOne more slavish compliment: My friend and I were wearing touristy beach clothes and were treated very well by the owner and staff.  To me, this lack of pretense speaks volumes about the class of the restaurant and the management.  Good show, and thank you for an excellent time!","stars":5}

But then, after four years I had the worst encounter with the owner, one that I will not forget.\n\nI went in on my graduation morning to have breakfast with my older brother and older cousin on the go. I desperately needed coffee because I had celebrated with my roommates the night before my 9am. It was like 7:15a so they were not that busy at all on Sunday morning after finals week. I ordered my bagel and a LARGE coffee. They are not known for there AMAZING cups of coffee with me, but this cup had been made wrong. I used to work at a coffee bar so I kind of know my way around a coffee maker and this cup had grounds and was reeeeeally bitter. I usually don't ask for replacements, but I just asked nicely to the owner who was ringing up my brother if they could rebrew the coffee or if I could get the other type because this one wasn't tasting right.\n\nThe owner grunted at me and said \"thats how we make our coffee, I can water it down for you if you want.\" I couldnt believe he said this and felt very attacked so I replied to him that he could taste it if he wanted to.

{"region":"WEST","text":"This is now my favorite Thai restaurant. Hubby and I ordered lunch to go today here for the first time.\n\nI had the Pad Woon Sen and hubby had the Pad Thai. Both were excellent!\n\nThe appetizer (the fried potato puff was yummy - instead of little potato pieces, they are mashed and creamy, like biting into a fluffy cloud.)\n\nThe peanut salad dressing for the side salad for lunch was very goo. It had a nice balance of peanut flavor and savories without one over powering the other. Just wish the salad portion is slightly bigger.\n\nI agree with Adele G that the spiciness rating is much more potent here than at other Thai restaurants. I believe their spiciness rating is more true to the Thai rating instead of the watered down American rating. I usually order my Thai food 5 spiciness from other restaurants but ordered 3 here, which was just perfect. So if you're used to other restaurants' spiciness ratings, be sure to tone it down here.  The gentleman who took our order over the phone did warn us that 3 star spicy is very very hot. Luckily for me, that's just the right amount of spice for me!\n\nI also requested my Pad Woon Sen to be less salty, and they got it just right. Usually, I have to tell other restaurants to tone the salt way down in order to get what I want, but this place just gets it right the first time from me merely requesting\"less salty\". So I really appreciate that. \n\nOverall, hubby and I are really pleased with this restaurant and our selections. It's nice to finally have a quality Thai restaurant in Sparks so we don't have to drive to Reno for Thai food. We'll definitely visit again, hopefully, eat in next time!","stars":5}

From what we could see, the kitchen area was not very clean. \n\nNotwithstanding doing an online checkin through Yelp's waitlist service about 20-30 minutes before arrival (which was the estimated wait time at the time), we still had to wait an extended period. It appears that adding ourselves to the waitlist did not appear to have helped at all. Not sure if the restaurant does not honor the Yelp feature or if there was some other problem.\n\nTaste is average, not much better than a regular diner about town for the kinds of dishes we tried (naturally you won't get the exact same dishes since they are somewhat creative, but you'd get similar items).

Here are a few more things that went wrong:\nMy table request, that I made weeks prior, was not honored. We had to sit near the noisy kitchen.\nThe server did not follow proper wine serving protocol - I know I sound like a snob saying that but he should've known better. They did have an amazing wine list though and a beautiful wine cellar though.\nThe wrong orders came out. \nOur steaks were severely under cooked, I have never seen my boyfriend send a steak back but we both had to this time.\nThe sommelier went around to literally ever table except ours though I could clearly see we bought the most expensive bottle (I guess I should mention my boyfriend and I look very young - we occasionally get treated this way and it drives me nuts)\nServer was mostly MIA, I had to hunt down other severs and the hostess for help.\nLast but not least, the food was above average but as good as it should've been for the price. \nHere's a quick review of the food:\nCaprese Salad: Came with a lot of chese but was still pretty mediocore, skip it\nWedge salad: had a bite of my boy friend's, it was pretty good, i would order this over the caprese.\nFilet Mignon: For this price, the worst I have ever had, thats not to say it wasnt good, but of all the filets I have ever had, this one would be in last place, skip it\nNew York: again, had a bite of my boy friends, it was very good, better than mine, and he enjoyed it as well, go with the New York over the filet.\nCreamed Spinach: not all creamy, a bit bland, skip it.\nPotatoes McMahons: scalloped potatoes with green chiles and cheese.

Eventually, the other lemonades at the table were finished and refills were brought but never the lemonade for my sister. \nWe order apps (hummus, lamb flatbread and duck fries). Duck fries were good but the others not so much. \nAs we are waiting to have our order taken, we ask for the heat lamp next to us to be turned on and it never is. Eventually I get up and ask the manager to do so. He does.\nWhen the sever takes our order, he informs us that he is out of all salmon and lamb (this constitutes a big portion of the menu.

Finally our food comes out. All the food at the table is met with \"meh\" responses. \nMaybe your wondering if my sister ever got her lemonade?

We've never done a bnb, usually staying at a nice resort or hotel. I am so happy we made the switch on staying here. We got done with work later than expected on Thur afternoon and hit the road, expecting to arrive around 8pm vs our 4pm window. I called the Simpson House to let them know and they said it was no problem at all. When we finally arrived, someone was already waiting out front to greet us, her name was Barbara. She was really sweet and explained the grounds, main house and took us to our cottage.  It was so beautiful and Barbara was so sweet about our late arrival that she saved us a delicious plate of appetizers from the earlier 530-630 happy hour.\n\nI booked the Abbeywood Cottage because of great things I read about it. It was cozy and quaint but perfect for the two of us. Had a fireplace that we used frequently, a nice tub and great shower. I loved the high ceilings and skylights. The queen bed was really comfortable with amazing linens. The pillows were a tad soft but that is personal preference so no real complaints. Wonderful Kiehl products to use in the bathroom\/tub. We were very happy with our choice of rooms!\n\nThe first morning we came to breakfast about 9:15 (it is served from 8:30-9:30). Kerry was the day shift and she was amazing. You know when you meet someone who is very genuine in both their conversation and listening to you speak? Hard to find....but Kerry was just a total pleasure to talk with. The breakfast was delicious (soda bread, potato frittata, fresh fruit)! Add a couple mimosas, fresh juice, good coffee and we were off to a great start. We roamed State St that day and came back in time for a nap and then hit happy hour from 5:30-6:30. Tons a great little bites and delicious wine to try. We lounged on two chairs in the garden and just kicked back, enjoying the birds, wind, sound of fountains. We have two little ones at home so relaxing isn't something we get to do often. That evening Kerry helped our choice of restaurants and made us a reservation at Opal, which was nearby. I am soooo happy she recommended it. We had amazing dinner together there....I will review Opal on their site separately but i highly recommend it! Especially the Phyllo Shrimp appetizer, ahi, and lemongrass salmon entree. Cruised the street for a while after dinner and came home to a couple desserts in the main house and settled in. Slept great again and had an amazing final breakfast before heading back to San Diego. One more thing to mention....the woman who cleaned our room came twice a day....cleaned in the morning and turned down in the evening. It was so beautiful and I really appreciated the extra little attention to detail with it.\n\nWe will definitely be coming back. Kerry said the hayloft is one of her favorite rooms and we are hoping to give that a try, although I am assuming all of the rooms are wonderful. I really hope both Kerry and Barbara are there when we return as they both made it so special for us.","stars":5}

The studio environment is very welcoming and people of all levels practice side-by-side. I've gained so much inner peace by coming here that I don't even think hateful thoughts about the people who easily hop into headstand and balance like gravity doesn't impact them (anymore). I come here for mental and physical health and I feel like the classes strike a good balance between the two. I appreciate the teachers and feel like they each bring something special to offer their students. In these times, when its so hard to find genuine community Temple is an amazing refuge. If you are looking for a place where you can come as you are and feel welcome, included, stronger and more flexible check out Temple. You won't be sorry.","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"It's been a minute since last I stopped by Silver Peak, and I am really sorry it's been so long.  They have been a cornerstone in Midtown since before it was even Midtown, and remains a great spot for good beer and excellent food, so it was high time I swung back in for a pint or two.\n\nAs the beers go, they have their flagships and a few rotating seasonals and specialties.  For starters, the Peavine Porter remains one of my absolute favorite dark beers in our region, and is my go-to whenever I come in.  Tonight I also got to try the Chinook, a west coast IPA with great hoppiness, along with the Big Daddy Hooch, a dopplebock style beer I found exceptionally tasty, but which, at 10.6%, will certainly double-knock your socks off.\n\nThe food was as good as ever.  Ended up going with the Bratwurst Sliders, which were exceptionally tasty.  And started off with some very nice BBQ Wings and a side of their awesome beat chips.  Anyone coming here should also give thought to their pizza, as I have always been extremely impressed with how delicious it is, as my friends were on this evening.\n\nPrices are pretty decent for this part of town, especially if you show up during happy hour, and the service has always been very prompt and courteous, especially with the owners themselves being hands-on and checking in on customers.  Their main location on Wonder Street is very easy to find, as it sort of towers above the intersection of Virginia, Vassar, and Holcomb, with parking usually pretty easy to get into.  And if the weather is nice, do make sure to try and snag a seat on their rooftop deck, as it is one of the best outdoor seating areas in the city.\n\nAll in all, if you are on the hunt for good pint and a bite, you should for sure keep Silver Peak in mind.  As one of the first breweries to have sprung up in Reno they hold a place in the history of beer in our town, and I will certainly be returning again in the future.\n\nCheers, guys!","stars":4}

I was disappointed with my room it was OK for the price a bit outdated but clean. The shower was weird as the shower head was so low you had to bend down to wet your head WTH. The walls are paper thin as we heard our neighbors next door having a party (college kids we think). We called the front desk and to their credit they responded right away and the noise simmered down. I did not enjoy my meal at the Prime Rib Dinner house on property for the following reasons: #1 we had to wait about 15-20 minutes while the host finished his conversation with his girlfriend before he greeted my party and another to ask us if we wanted a table or to put our name on the wait list. (keep in mind this place was not busy) Once seated the waiter took about 20 minutes before he stopped by to take our order for drinks (almost like he didn't want to be there). After we ordered and our dinner arrived we didn't see our waiter again until the end of the dinner you know the time you are out of conversation and start looking around for somebody  to give you the tab. I ordered a steak medium and received it rare...I ate what I could and wrote this place off. You do get a fair amount of food that is decent and they even throw in the salad however with such bad service I will not go back at any price.

I pay that, and if by chance I get another dust spec or rock in the condensor, I am back again.\nWhat gets me is that service guy told me he's had 3 of the cars in there this week with the same problem!

{"region":"WEST","text":"I found a dress on David's Bridal website that was perfect for an event I was attending a week and a half away. I made an appointment online to try it on so I was ensured I would have a consultant and told my mom to meet me there. I don't know what typical busy days are at David's, but I came in on a Sunday afternoon and it was moderately busy. I told them I had an appointment and knew exactly what dress I was trying on, a consultant grabbed it and we went to a dressing room. Now, this was a ball gown with a huge skirt and I am five foot zero so I kind of needed help but my consultant zoomed off before I could request it. I managed to get myself into it but still needed someone to zip me up. My consultant was nowhere to be found. My mom found my dressing room and ended up zipping me up. The dress fit great and I put it on hold until the next day. I called to discuss alterations and the woman on the phone couldn't tell me if my dress would be done by the party date. She then began to lecture me on my last minute alterations. I hardly ever wear ball gowns and the like, so I didn't realize a week and a half was last minute for alterations. Anyway, I needed a yes or no answer, not a lecture so I went elsewhere for alterations and ended up extremely happy especially after hearing David's charges crazy alteration fees that end up costing more than the dress. All in all I felt because I wasn't a bride purchasing a $1000 dress I was overlooked. If they had another dress I fall I love with I would return, but begrudgingly and I wouldn't get it altered there.","stars":2}

She said it was terrific as was her soup.  (Review once removed.)\nService was terrific\/solicitous. Only downside was the seating.

{"region":"WEST","text":"We came in here late on New Years day, around 8 PM. They were very welcoming and friendly. Not what you'd expect for a staff working late on a holiday. We kind of stumbled across the Santa Barbara location looking for something open that late on New Years day. We had forgotten that they had just recently opened there and we were pleasantly surprised.\n\nWe're from the L.A. area and we've always been big fans of Killer Shrimp since their days on the upper level of a strip mall in Marina del Rey. Back then, their menu only consisted of \"the original\" shrimp in a bowl with broth, shrimp with rice, or shrimp with pasta. I've never tried anything other than \"the original\", even when they added more to the menu. We both ordered \"the original\", shells on of course. It was just as luxurious as we remembered. I was afraid that the addition of so many items to their menu might somehow corrupt what made them a great little eatery in the first place. But \"the original\" was as perfect as ever with the dozen or so jumbo shrimp in a bowl of spicy broth, complemented by the french bread for dipping and sopping up the \"juice\".\n\nThe manager (forgot his name) was very friendly, stopping by to chat occasionally and making sure we didn't need anything.\n\nOverall, 5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service.","stars":5}

There's curbside pickup parking makes it quick and easy.  Carryout only right now. The pizza, ordered with light sauce and extra cheese and this was made perfect! The crust is very NY style with just enough thickness on the outer edge to be a bit crispy and still have some \"bread\" to it.  One of the top pizzas in Tucson. Now the elote pizza. Doesn't sound right, I know, but give it a try and you will not want to share your piece.  The flavors are matched extremely well and you will be amazed every time you take a bite. I know we were. We got two slices just to try it and we were left wanting more. Now the desert flight.. the favorite in our house was the NY Cheesecake by far the best of the desserts. Firm, dense and creamy with a lightly sweet crust. The pumpkin cheesecake was almost as good.  Next was the panna cotta which by itself was tart and creamy the blueberries complimented it well as could any semi sweet fruit. The cinnamon rolls were well made and the cream-cheese icing was spot on with lots of cinnamon on the soft inside and crunchy outside of the rolls. The tiramisu finished the flight with all the right flavors but couldn't beat out the others for a higher spot. Stop in for a slice or take a whole pizza home you won't be disappointed.  Next time I will try the cannoli....","stars":5}

When I went there the next day, the actual charge was about $200 more than what the rep promised due to an overnight fee.

Different colors with mushrooms and red peppers and something green that I don't remember what it is. \n\nCalamari-north is probably my favorite place for calamari. It's fried and crispy yet doesn't feel too oily or heavy, and the sauce is not sweet at all (not a big fan of sweet salty calamari)\n\nMussels were good but I like unions better, they're slightly bigger too. \n\nThe bad:\nMy dish, the bolognese, was just meh. It was average in flavor, a little better than spaghetti I make, pasta good, but it just looked so disappointing. And for 17$... \n\nService: I understand it was a busy day but we had to wait at least 15 min and then ask our server just to get bread. He also said Guiness from a can is better than draught.

{"region":"WEST","text":"One would think that having bought two separate A.R.E. truck caps plus a spray-on truck liner from Trim-Line, we would be treated as an established customer by Trim-Line.  But NOOOO, didn't mean a thing.\n\nWe came in for a repair of the flip up rear window of our A.R.E. truck cap where we had damaged the lift mechanism (screws and struts) due to bringing home long split rail posts and rails.  We just wanted to get that rear window fixed, knowing we caused the damage.  The glass lay in the back of the truck, totally intact. \n\nThe guy at the desk told us the replacement glass would cost $900.00, and offered some scenarios as to what was wrong with the window.  We said maybe someone should go out and look at the truck and give an informed assessment.  \n\nWe waited for the mechanic who said it was entirely fixable, needed some replacement screws (which had worked themselves out) plus some strut(s).  We left with the understanding that the proper parts would be ordered, and once arrived, we would be notified so that a date for repair could be set.\n\nA few days later, someone from Trim-Line called to say the screws would be $2.50 and the struts $50.00.  When I said \"when should we come in for the repair,\" were told the parts had not been ordered as yet, because they wanted to wait until they came in.  \n\nAt this point I wondered why the repair progressed so PIECE MEAL, but decided to wait for their call to commence with the repair date.  We didn't hear from them, so we called back to find out how the parts arrival was progressing.\n\nAt this point we found out that THE PARTS STILL HAD NOT BEEN ORDERED BECAUSE\na waiver was needed by Trim-Line absolving them from liability for our rear cap window in case it should shatter during the repair.\n\nSo, nobody informed us of that waiver, which was entirely to cover their own ..... when we first came in for the repair.  Nobody informed us when they called us about the cost of the parts, which they could have told us during their follow up phone call.  Nobody told us, PERIOD, that the entire repair was contingent on us signing a waiver before any parts would be ordered or any repair be scheduled. \n\nWell, if Trim-Line was the last dealer in the universe, I would just as soon contact any dealer in the universe before dealing with Trim-Line again.  They are incompetent, and incredibly rude in dealing with customers.  They are under the impression that jerking customers around is not rude, but they need to understand that ineptitude and incompetence is RUDE.  \n\nThere are other truck cap dealers in the Reno\/Sparks\/Carson City area.  Check them out before you become part of a clusterf..k.","stars":1}

Yes, video poker at the bar. \nIs it kid friendly?  I'd say no but I've seen many a kid eating French fries at the tables. \n\nThere's not a lot of fine dining options at RNO so I look for a place closest to my gate.

The young man that recently served me on my last visit went above and beyond getting me chips from the store next door.  Yes, they're the same place but some bartenders don't want to cross that line.  Plus he was hustling to make sure customers got what the needed before they had to leave for their flights.

I am one of these people with seafood loving friends. When offered good company, you learn to compromise. Thankfully I did not have to compromise when I came here which was amazing and I am incredibly thankful. Our waiter was very attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. I ordered the spinach salad and told him I was vegan and assumed that was my only option. He informed me there is a vegan chefs plate, which consists of whatever is in the kitchen. I was definitely not disappointed in any of the selections brought out in that vegan platter.    All of the veggies were seasoned  individually and perfectly, on top of being cooked and prepared beautifully. The salad as well was extraordinary, very fresh, loads of textures, loads of flavor and I could not wolf it down fast enough. While I do not suggest coming here as a lone vegan, should the need arise and you must go do not fear!","stars":5}

With that said we rarely ever go to this place, maybe once in a blue moon when we are craving it but today happened to be that day. I ordered us \"Duros\" \"Pin Wheel shaped chips\" with out any Chile, Lim\u00f3n etc. just by themselves a \"Chamango\" which is an \"icy drink with chunks of mango, Chile etc.\" \"Ezquite\" \"Toasted Corn kernels with lime juice, mayonnaise, grated cheese, chili powder, butter, and hot sauce etc\" and last but not least I ordered a \"Fresa Raspado\" \"Strawberry Icy Drink\" long order short...I paid and walked back to the office. Then about 5-10 minutes go by & My Boss and I are enjoying our drinks. While talking about how they guy that served us did a really good job and despite problems with this place in the past we were glad we came back. A moment after that my Boss looked down at his \"Fresa Raspado\" \"Strawberry Icy Drink\" and low & behold to his surprise guess what he saw in it...... a COCKROACH! My Boss was really UPSET and I don't Blame him! We were both completely and utterly Grossed Out! We Immediately stoped drinking our drinks! I packed everything back up and brought it back right away! When I got there I told the guy who served us that we had a problem with our order. We  just wanted to return the whole thing and get our money back. The employee didn't speak much English and I only know the bare minimals when it comes to Spanish but he gave me my money back right away. I told him I needed either a business card or the owners name as well as business information as I would be filing a \"formal complaint\" with the Health Department! He didn't understand me and ended up having to call his wife to Translate. I told her the exact same thing and All she could do was translate between him and I. They both blamed it on their \"Distributor\" in California and said the Cockroach came from them as he had opened a new package of Flavoring for the \"Raspado\" I told them it doesn't Matter if it's the \"Distributor's\" Fault or if the cockroach came from the uncleanliness of the place.. I told them both I would be calling the Health Department as it's a \"Health Code Violation\"","stars":1}

She is extremely meticulous and takes the time to discuss with you what you prefer and makes that come to life. On top of that, she is incredibly astute and observant, and gave me advice on how to fill in\/maintain my brows, pointing out how I can help my \"bad brow\" (we all have that one we don't like) behave.

Service was good in that they were busy and there was going to be a bit of a wait for next batch of chicken, but they let us know so I appreciate that. Biggest thing I have to complain about is the restaurant environment. The place is like a meat locker and there is no outdoor seating if you don't want to eat in your car. It was warmer outside at night where temps say 64 then it was inside the restaurant. I had 2 jackets on, one with a hood thank goodness, and I was still cold. It was not just me. Everyone I saw eating inside was bundled up or looking very uncomfortable since they didn't think they needed to bring their arctic gear when they left their house to dine out. I know the kitchen must get hot, but they need to find a way to close off AC vents into dining area.

Once I was in the room I was going to receive a massage in, she asked me what it was she could do for me today and what my problem areas were. I told her I have had this problem spot on my back (which I've told all my past masseuses) but this time she actually was communicating with me to help me workout that spot. I did some head and leg lifts on command and through her magic hands my back has never felt better.

{"region":"WEST","text":"Overall, I am glad I experienced the unique atmosphere and food selection at Island Plate Lunch. The main reason why I came here was to try poi. I usually enjoy dishes and drinks with taro, so I thought I would give it a go and ordered the laulau plate. The consistency was very liquid, like thin pudding. I used it to dip the kalua shredded pork. The taste is strangely mild, and I couldn't taste any hints of taro. Personally, it did not elevate the taste of other items. The pork was decent, and although slightly slimy, I enjoyed the spinach-like greens that was stuffed in the laulau leaves. Additionally, I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ chicken. I appreciated the seasoning of the chicken: it had that freshly grilled, smokey flavor. Unfortunately, I found the dark meat a bit fatty. The macaroni salad was condensed with mustard and mayo. It was too rich for my taste, and I only could take a few bites. The star of the meal was the butter mochi. I love coconut and mochi; the two combined is pure gold. As for the restaurant itself, there isn't much seating making the tables uncomfortably close.

{"region":"WEST","text":"This is a bummer. I wish I had written a 5-star review in the past when Octopus earned it on every single visit. They have been \"my\" car wash place. Drive in dirty, leave sparkling clean, inside and out. \n\nLast week I visited for the Ultimate Wash, the only wash I ever get. They were well-staffed with employees waiting for cars to come through the wash so they could wipe the inside, dry the exterior, and detail the windows. I always know what to expect: a spiffy clean car. \n\nWhile I waited inside the interior building and waiting room smelled strongly of raw sewage. It was more than someone just making a stink in the bathroom, it was pungent upon entering and never subsided. I asked if there is a plumbing problem and was told that there wasn't. I told the employee that it doesn't usually smell bad in there and she told me she doesn't smell anything. \n\nOn my way from the car wash I noticed there were areas of the dash and console that were missed. I got home and looked it over and most fo the interior wasn't touched which is odd because there were about 10 employees working the post-wash details. It was also amazing how quickly they were done on this specific trip, but I figured they have so many people working that they make quick work of cleaning. \n\nThe next day I went back to inquire what the Ultimate includes. I was told for the interior \"we wipe down the interior including the dash, console, and front doors\". I showed here that those things were obviously not done, and she quickly corrected what she had said, \"Well, it's actually more of a light dusting\". I showed her where there was obviously no \"light dusting\" done on my vehicle and she assured me that the light dusting wasn't really going to get anything clean. This has certainly not been the case on previous visits. \n\nI've recommended Octopus Cash Wash for years. I'm not sure what has changed, but it's not a change for the better. I cannot recommend them, and I won't be back.","stars":2}

It's in a great artsy area, right next to Tap + Bottle (another really cool establishment). They roast their own coffee and it is definitely worth trying (and maybe bringing a bag home too!). The space itself is really cool- exposed brick and rustic tables with plenty of space to sit and spread out. I love the metal and glass storefront that provides tons of natural light, and the excellent design carries all the way down to their logo t-shirts for sale. \n\nMy boyfriend and I each got a honey latte (one hot and one iced) and they were both amazing. We sat outside on the adorable mismatched chairs and split a granola muffin (fuel for hiking at Saguaro National Park that morning!). The total for all three items was under $10, and this current-East-Coast-resident had to rub my eyes in disbelief at the low price! Two speciality lattes and a muffin in Philly would easily run $14+! On top of that, the barista was friendly and helpful and seemed like a great resource for local spots that would actually be places we would want to go. All in all, a total gem.

We like the location since Reno has so much run down, seediness downtown.  Really nice rooms with more than the usual amenities and we hit our biggest jackpot there, so far, which really helps endear a place to indifferent gamblers.

{"region":"WEST","text":"GDW, let me first say I'm very appreciative of how generous you are with free play offers, even to us lower rollers and newer \"unproven\" customers. And I love the Grille, I think it's the best place for breakfast in Reno (and your burgers and that prime rib dinner aren't a bad deal either.) Add in 2x points and a 1.99 fairly big breakfast overnight every night and you are really exceptionally generous compared to most of the tightassed casinos in Reno that want you to drop $2000 a month before they'll even give you 2 bucks in comps. \n\nBut there's a couple of problems in this relationship that I want to talk about. Now, I don't WANT to just come in when you offer free play, use said free play to win 15 or 20 bucks, and then roll out after only playing for 15 minutes or so. I want to spend much more time playing here. I play mostly video poker and I notice you have certain machines that are consistently 10\/8\/6 for basic Jacks Or Better. That's fantastic. But one problem is that I'm not a smoker, and you don't have a non-smoking area. The other problem is that those particular machines are Game King machines. Nearly all of them are always hemmed up. Hemmed up with people taking advantage of the generous full pay tables? No - hemmed up with people playing Caveman Keno. Fucking CAVEMAN KENO. You can play Caveman Keno and its terrible odds (and annoying sound effects) on nearly any machine in the joint, really any machine in Reno. But no - they have to sit on the handful of machines with the best pay tables and play it. And chain smoke the stinkiest cigarettes while doing it.\n\nThe other issue is your hotel. I've heard it's very cool. I'd like to stay sometime. The problem is, at least according to your website, you want 40 bucks a night on a weeknight for a smoking room. The suites - which I assume are the only non-smoking option? - are 50 bucks a night. I don't want to risk getting all my clothes and possessions all stanky, and I can get perfectly nice and acceptable rooms elsewhere for a lot less than 50 bucks nearby, so that deal just isn't going down. \n\nGDW, you get a 4 anyway because I really am a fan. When I can get up and get over here by 6 or 7 am, have a nice affordable breakfast at the Grille, and then play the good machines before the trailer crew rolls in to camp out for the day, it's a great time. Under optimal conditions you are easily a 4, maybe better. But optimal conditions are in a real narrow window. Outside of those hours, the Peppermill has the same nice pay tables but also more spacious, less inconsiderate trash and Billy Brokeass Badass trailer dudes leering at everyone, and even a non-smoking section, so .... but I'll at least be back for breakfast, and to enjoy free play until I start choking to death","stars":4}

Occasionally there are horses circling the lake which is always fun to watch.

Most of the complaints though were about the van and the TERRIBLE experience people had on it. So much so that some were suggesting taking a greyhound instead, since it was significantly cheaper. I decided to bite the bullet and paid the $41. It's an hour and a half, how bad can it be?!\n\nEver since they took over for sky harbor express, I think they took over their vans. These are NICE, large, new Mercedes Benz passenger vans. Even if they were full, there's plenty of leg room. The AC works just fine, the seats are comfy. They must have a new fleet because none of the previous complaints even applied. Your luggage is in the van, it's no longer towed behind. \n\nYes the driving was a little fast, yes it's expensive at 41 one way (they pretty much have a monopoly. It's them or the greyhound) but if you need a ride between major cities in Arizona, they are a great company. Don't let the other reviews scare you, like they did me.","stars":4}

The dark breads are dense and make great toast and sandwiches. I treated my self to an upside down cake shaped like a hat on my last visit.

{"region":"WEST","text":"The concept of this is great. A bus picks you up. You caravan to wineries with strangers. You have a host or hostess to educate and keep you informed and on a time schedule. You drink, you learn, you see some amazing countryside, you have a nice little lunch from Nielsens.\n\nOur bus driver was Shawn. Seemed nice. But you could tell it's his zillionth tour. I personally have only wine tasted once. I like the idea of a tour where you can experience a few other wineries and not have to worry about a designated driver.  I am thankful we had Shawn as our DBD (designated bus driver) but he lacks a smidge in the hospitality department. Extremely short. His way or the highway. We were a small group for a bridal shower. We were not a crazy rowdy bunch nor did we have a list of things for Shaun to do. He seemed put out any time we had to interact with him. Which made you not want to engage him or ask a question if you had one. The only time he seemed to be nice or put on a little charm was on the way back when he expected a 15% gratuity. The tip from me would have been \"be kinder and a little less rough around the edges and people might be more generous.\"\n\nThe price of a tour is pricey. But when you factor in all of the tasting fees, fuel, lunch and a safe ride and back it's worth it. Would I ever request Shawn? NO. A tour with another Wine Edventurer might be the best thing to do. \n\nThe bus we were on had NO air conditioning. Sadly we toured on a day where it was 100 degrees. Wine Edventures should consider getting the a\/c fixed or using buses with air conditioning.\n\nThey provide water bottles. It was room temp. Finally the waters were iced down but we ran out at the last winery. On hotter days they should consider icing down more than one case of water. Especially if the bus has 22 guests.\n\nThe lunch was 1\/2 sandwich, 1 cup of Greek salad, bag of potato chips and a cookie. It was a nice size but I would definitely pack a small bag of wine appropriate snacks. Nuts, cheese, crackers, grapes, strawberries... While trying the wines I really wanted to pair it with a little food. Our group did bring some snacks but I would definitely recommend bringing some small bites. \n\nYou do do a bit of walking and the tour was basically 10-5. You definitely need a little more body fuel especially if you are going to be drinking! So bring snacks and water!\n\nOut of four stops I really only liked two. We don't have control of where we go. It is nice to try new things. Now I can eliminate two from my list shall I ever go again.\n\nWine Edventures I gave you a five eventhough with Sean I would have liked to give you a three star. But why ruin a 5 star rating with a sour grape tour guide. Thank you Wine Edventures for a fun day with the girls.","stars":5}

They remake it but the time it takes is ridiculous.   \n\nMy latest with them was that I sent one of my co-workers Debbie, to get drinks for the office and of course they added banana to mine. Even after it was made wrong the first time and they had to remake it.  Unfortunately the second mistake wasn't caught until it was in my hands at the office.  So back Debbie went after I called and spoke with the manager asking to have one remade and waiting for her when she arrived. It was like speaking to a drone.  He was monotone and did not apologize, just said it would be ready. Our office is not close to their location and did they offer to make it right? No.  I was hoping they would offer a free drink in the future so that I could give it to Debbie for her troubles and time.  \n\nSome might think going to Eegee's is the answer but really I think some employee training is the better response.","stars":2}

Nearly everyone was bait fishing and crabbing. \n\nI found an open spot and since I already had a 3\/4 oz spoon rigged thought I'd give it a try before switching to bait.  After my first cast a kid to my right offered me some of his bait.  I accepted at first but then on my second cast I hooked a nice sized 12\" mackerel.  Everyone was reeling in mackerel, often 3 at a time and filling their buckets.  I ended up getting 5 decent sized mackerel over about 45min.  \n\nThe guy to my left was surprised to see me land so many fish without any bait.

Do you have any control over this? No. Hypothetically, let's say they have 100 patients under Blue Shield, and ANY of their nurses decides to freelance for ANYONE AT ALL and pays using Blue Shield, the Agency gets to charge you $7500 and collects a cool 3\/4 MILLION DOLLARS.

I always enjoy a cheese steak sandwich which are always fresh and delicious and my fiance loves the turkey club! Our bill for 2 is always under or right at $20 and we always have left overs! If you like cheese and steak come on, you know where to go! Also there fries are made to order and I like to use them to scoop up the cheese and steak that falls off my yummy sandwich! They.also have a drive through if you want to just grab and go but I prefer to dine in especially in summer and eat our on there little covered patio!

However, I had previously seen pictures and reviews mentioning there can be a long line to get to the tasty breads. I decided to go for it regardless, making it to Barrio slightly after 9am on a Friday.\n\nThere were people quickly coming and going, but no line extending down the block! Hurray! This was great as it allowed us to chat with Don, the owner and baker, and get a better idea of his background and his passion. \n\nI love that his breads are so locally sourced it's ridiculous. I love that he is very particular about his grains and knowing exactly from where they are coming. So cool. He gave us a sample of bread - fresh, still warm, and I was salivating. I made sure to ask him to see if his bread was vegan friendly - and it 100% is! He said all of his breads are (ya know, minus the cheddar jalapeno), and then it gave me the open door to grab whatever I wanted!\n\nI went with a Heritage loaf (one with the Arizona state and a Saguaro design) and one of their $1 rolls. My sister grabbed the Pan de Kino (the loaf with the arizona flag design). They were very tasty (most of it I had once I made it back home to SLC), and a lot more sour than I was expecting. But still super amazing, and it kept it's poofy softness for a long time!\n\nI was a little disappointed that they didn't have the foccia ready yet - they put it out after 11am. It just means I will need to stop by again when next in Tucson. Get all the bread here! You won't regret it!","stars":5}

Their cocktails are very fresh and creative, I had 1944 Mai Tai and she had the Blackberry Thyme Margarita. We had the Fisherman's Spring Rolls to start, one of which is lobster and the other is crab. Both were very tasty and because of the three different dipping sauces served with the spring rolls, peanut, sweet chili, and cilantro soy, it was more like having six different styles of spring rolls. For our entrees, my fianc\u00e9 had the Short Ribs with Massaman Curry (Gaeng Massaman Neua) and I had the Chaing Mai Style Pork Stew (Kaeng Hung Leh). The short ribs were in a moderately spicy peanut curry sauce along with some vegetables. The meat was very tender and not full of fat like some short ribs can be. The pork stew was served in a somewhat spicy, yet not overpowering yellow curry with vegetables as well.  We opted for brown rice to be served with our entrees instead of white rice and finished our meal with the Dessert sampler, four decedent chocolate desserts that was the perfect size to share between two people. The service was quick and very helpful. Overall we really enjoyed our experience, which is why we return time and time again. Definitely worth checking out!","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"DONT ORDER THE FILET\n\nWent here as a friend was preparing for her Marathon the next morning and needed to carbo load. I on the other hand was craving a nice juicy steak and ordered the Filet Mignon which on the menu states is a \"house specialty\". As the food started to come out, everything looked and smelled amazing. Then, they brought out my filet. I could tell by just looking at it that it was raw. Cut into it, and it was literally cold and raw. Out waitress, Robin, who was very polite and professional came by and I showed her the steak and she immediately took it back. She made a few comments that the chefs refuse to use thermometers and this happens all the time... Seriously \"chef\" if you can't cook a filet you really shouldn't be cooking. And a thermometer? Yea you should use one if you consistently serve raw steaks. Amateur hour. Which is surprising as Palace is a Santa Barbara cornerstone. I'm shocked the health department hasn't caught wind. Anyway, Robin brings back out what I expected to be a new filet cooked to a nice medium. What I got was the same filet I had cut up and it was just re-fired... Anyone who knows anything about cooking knows there is one key element to cooking a nice steak and thats getting a nice sear to lock in the juices. If you re-fire an already cut open raw filet you're just serving tough and rubbery meat. I flagged Robin over and told her this was not acceptable and she agreed and took it away. At that point, the rest of my party was already about half way into their meals so I just didn't order anything else. Long story short, the definition of insanity is making the same mistake over and over again and not learning from it. Apparently The Palace Grill has an issue with Filets and their chef. Lastly, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of effort by their manager on duty to \"make it right\". He never once came over to apologize or offer anything to remedy the situation. Perhaps he thought Robin had handled the situation well, which she did, but come on man, if you're going to run a restaurant step up and own your mistakes and make it right. The restaurant was half empty so it being busy isn't really an excuse here. The Palace has always been a great place to eat if you're feeling that type of grub but the fact that our waitress told me this happens all the time and the chef refuses to do better makes me really worried. If someone who was a bit shy decided to just eat it instead of \"complaining\" they could get really, really sick but yet this restaurant is knowingly just letting this happen...","stars":2}

She happily shared with me their focus on tackle, bait, and equipment focused on local species only.  Yes, their retail strip square footage is tight, but they cram a lot of product on their shelves for the local angler.  If you want box store, then drive however many miles @ $3.75 a gallon to save $2 on a $12 lure.  If you'd rather spend that drive time FISHING, then support this local business, maybe ask for a tip\/pointer (which I suspect she'd gladly give), and get out on the water!

I recommend this restaurant wholeheartedly, especially for tourists because of the use of fresh, local ingredients + wines. \n\nThe seacuterie fisherman's plate is a MUST - fantastic value and flavor. Also a good idea to get a reservation (which you can do through opentable.com). This restaurant is vegetarian-friendly, as well!","stars":5}

The salon is very clean and welcoming; I was assigned to Samantha who has years of experience and is very friendly. She did a great job in making sure I was comfortable and the atmosphere was great. I was offered something to drink and we settled in. Although the service was for shellac, I prefer good old OPI polish and there was no problem with that. Samantha did a really good job trimming, filing, etc and the polish application was flawless. It lasted 3 weeks, and could have gone even longer but I was ready for a new color!

{"region":"WEST","text":"Unfortunately, last Saturday I received the worst service ever from what was once my daily coffee shop. It's truly unfortunate as I literally visited the purple bean daily and preferred a local shop vs a large chain. \nI stopped here in the morning before a child's performance and ordered 4 hot cocoas, Carmel frappe cream base and a latte. When the barista brought my sons frappe he took a sip of his carmel frappe-cream based and said there was coffee in it. I kindly told her and she said \"you don't want coffee in it\" I said\" no it's for a child, that's why I asked for it to be cream based\". She literally rolled her eyes right in front of me and said \"You should have said no coffee then\". I apologized and said when I order it at Starbucks that's what they call it, frappe cream based (meaning no coffee) I didn't know\" and she rudely walked away. When she came back I said \"you know I come here daily and don't appreciate the attitude I'm receiving\" her response was \" I know you do\" with an I don't care tone. I said I just don't understand why the attitude, what's the need for it, is my order to Large today? She said \"well you could have came inside\". I responded with I didn't know there was a maximum order through the drive thru and she repeated herself \"again you could have came inside!\" At that point I told her I would never be back and she shrugged her shoulders.\nI have never been treated so rudely. In fact if 4 hot cocoas and 2 drinks were too much she could have kindly ask me to come in or took my order and asked if I could park and she'd bring it out to me. I do understand as it's only staffed with 2 gals the majority of the time but instead I was just treated like total crap. I will never give this place my business again! Adv of $1500 min a year lost from me.","stars":1}

{"region":"WEST","text":"THE WORST PLACE TO LIVE IN ISLA VISTA. My maintenance requests were pretty much ignored unless I called them 100 times a day. The rooms were tiny and not worth the price, everything was falling apart by the end of the year, and the design of this place is stupid. The balconies are built so close to each other that people just hop over and go into other people's rooms. This \"gated\" complex has gates that can easily be climbed over by a small child, but that didn't even matter because the locks were broken 99% of the time. The laundry machines only worked for the first few weeks of school and by the end of the year, only one or two of the machines were working for the whole building. Yeah the location was pretty good, but I would have rather lived on the sidewalk on the same street than live inside the building. If that doesn't explain how horrible this place was, then I don't know what else to say...\n\nAlso, the 4 & 5 star reviews for this place are hilarious. It sounds so rehearsed and unnatural.

My huevos rancheros tasted fine, but everything on the plate was around room temperature, and the eggs were on what seemed to be uncooked tortillas, like they came from a package and went straight to the plate. The refried beans were runnier than I like, a matter of individual taste, but they'd been spread on a cold plate and were almost chilly. I was the only customer at about 8:30 a.m., so it wasn't a case of a busy kitchen rushing food out. And the service, while not BAD, was impersonal and apathetic.

The bf and I stopped for gas at the mega Chevron next door, and then we went to check out the casino or whatever else was going on here adjacent in the next lot.  There are a few places to eat including their lobster buffet- none of which we indulged in nor are inclined to try.  We wondered around to find a gun show going on, but quickly discovered it was just a bunch of rednecks in a cafeteria lit banquet room chopping it up over brews (which were free apparently) with guns laid out all over the tables.   The casino is pretty small but spacious enough to move around comfortably and breathe with decent ventilation.  They have a nice selection of slot machines and playing tables.  The ambiance is decent if you like to gamble.  I dare not find out what a room for $19.99 or sometimes $39.99 a night feels like though.

The grilled tofu was terribly bland and had absolutely no substance. 3 strips of tofu and some chinese oatmeal for 18 dollars really? You can get so much better for that money in this town. I'd figure what it lacked in quantity they would make it up for quality. My girlfriend's filet mignon. Terribly small as well. The steak was the size of her pinky in length with literally two strips of asperagus. The price tag? $24. Again, what they lack in quantity is not made up in quality.

I didn't feel too comfortable about that. The moment we walked in, there were a lot of stares at the same time...I can't blame the staff for that though.\n\nService - 0 stars: Absolutely terrible. It was quite unwelcoming. Terrible attitude. The server who gave us our food gave an absolutely unacceptable look to a customer. My friend ordered his burger medium well well but the server gave him a medium rare. She essentially barked him that it he ordered medium rare. She didn't say, \"no I believe u ordered medium rare\" or my mistake I thought you ordered medium rare\". She rudely stated, \"No, you ordered medium rare.\" First of all, she wasn't even our waiter who was the one who took the order. She was the hostess. And the entire time she was giving the most disgusting,\"wtf are you serious?\" look for at least 10 seconds. It was so rude to the point where the other server tried to cover up the situation and tried to apologize, telling us that its not the kitchens fault but hers. She was quite a sweetheart. However, the other girl, didn't apologize and sort of stormed off. Stomped quite loudly back to the hostess booth. She must have had a bad day but that's no excuse. If you're gonna be rude, please do us all a favor and go home. I don't know how a place like this even allowed her to work here. I was so put off by her disrespectful attitude, I couldn't even eat. She was also texting on her phone the entire time as she was at the hostess booth. Had I known this place allowed such a level of unprofessional behavior, I wouldn't have come through that door. I gave this place a chance because of all the reviews. It was a mistake that I wish I could take back. Please train your staff properly.","stars":1}

{"region":"WEST","text":"I want to start off this review by saying that I loved, loved LOVED the food. It was amazing and everything I hoped it would be. I got the vegetarian $25 course menu but swapped the main course with the raw one.\nIt had:\n-homemade garlic hummus to start with carrot sticks and jicama\n-hot butternut soup of some sort with two croutons\n-watermelon mint juice (simply amazing)\n-a salad with orange slices and pomegranate seeds, among other things, served with apple\/carrot blend of juice\n-main course of raw thinly sliced squash with a pesto blend in between each slice, atop a layer of apples\n-and for dessert, a banana cake drizzled with chocolate that was probably the best banana cake I've ever had.\n\nThat being said, I am docking two stars for the service. I know this will be a bit controversial since this place has nothing but 5-star reviews. \n\nAccording to what I see here, our waitresses are also the owners of this restaurant.  While I totally respect that it must be hard to run a business and be a server at the same time, the person who served us was - how do I put this? - totally unsociable and disagreeable, albeit knowledgeable. \n\nLet me explain. My mom and I went there with two livingsocial vouchers, one that was mine and one that was hers. What we didn't notice at the time was that in the fine print, it said that only one can be used per table. When I told the owner that we had vouchers, she said, \"Sorry, did I hear you say voucherS?\" and when I said that yes, we had two, she said, \"You will ONLY be using one. You will have to come back to use the other one.\" But she said it in quite possibly the curtest and brusquest manner I've ever encountered, as though the discussion was over, the case was closed, and we were rather stupid to assume that we'd ever be able to use two vouchers at once. It was the tone of voice as if she was talking to a small child, actually. I tried to brush it off, since i figured that it really was our fault for not looking at the fine print, but it was disappointing nonetheless, and I didn't like the attitude she had about it.\n\nThroughout the meal, we had decent service...nothing special as we had to wait a few times for water refills, etc. It was okay.\n\nBut my real complaint, and what prompted the review, was the fact that we got pressured into tipping a lot.  And it wasn't just us, the couple sitting behind us used a coupon as well, and I heard her give them the same spiel.  I HATE being pressured to tip more. Disclaimer: I always tip on the pre-discounted amount, and I usually give a good tip according to the service received. \n\nSo anyway. The lady brought over what appeared to be a phone that the total was entered into, and said, \"Enter a tip here. Unfortunately, it calculates the tip based on the couponed amount and not the full amount, so make sure to figure out what the pre-discounted amount would be and tip on that.\" Uh, what? I'm sorry, but we are not required to tip on the pre-discounted amount. Like I said, I normally do, but the fact that she brought it up and basically bossed us into it rubbed me the wrong way, so we actually ended up tipping on the discounted amount. Seeing the amount we entered (which, talk about awkward, I don't like that she's hovering around you as you tip!) she said, with obvious anger, \"Oh, well if I had KNOWN you weren't going to tip on the full total, I would have just entered it the other way.\" Who says that?! I guess it's hard to communicate a tone of voice over a review from the internet, but trust me, it was snotty.  It was a bad way to end the meal, to say the least, and kind of confirmed that we did the right thing by tipping a little less.  Anyone who has that kind of entitled attitude when it comes to tipping is someone that needs a reality check. :\/ I don't owe anyone a fabulous tip, they have to earn it. Maybe I'm alone in this, but that is the reason for my 3-star review. I was uncomfortable with this and probably wouldn't return to The Tasteful Kitchen if it weren't for the fact that I have another voucher. I will enjoy the food, for sure, but I can't say I'm looking forward to encountering the service for a second time.","stars":3}

As his team kicks off the sale to the morning crowd, \"it's just stuff, be kind.\" There are so many treasures for everyone to find. The prices are so fair, the best I've ever seen in all my years of thrifting and estate sales. Sundays are half off you can't get a better deal. The \u00edtems for sale come from various estates, it's so well curated. Think the Tucson Museum of Art estate sale but better and monthly!! \n\nThe people that get there early, place their markers etc. know what they're doing when they get in. You may have to wait a very brief moment for ticket writer but there's someone or multiple people in every room who know what they are doing. And you're never in a position of missing out on something, just keep looking and wait your turn, there's maybe 2 people in front of you. \n\nCommon sense applies, all these people show up around the same time and will want to leave around the same time, there can be a line to check out just like at a grocery store. \n\nThere's a 3% fee for card transactions so bring cash or a checkbook and don't complain about supporting small business by having to pay the fee it's better for our local economy too. \n\nFor all the 1 star reviews i just have to say it makes me like Carchedi and his team even more.

We chose patio dining, but were told that the outdoor heaters were not operable because they lacked propane.  We selected a table from among the clean ones (there were several that needed cleaning).  Our server seemed a little disjointed - forgot part of the table setups, spilled wine and generally seemed a little tongue-tied.  We shared the Southwestern Caesar salad and found it to be tasty, but would have been much better had the cornbread croutons not been ice cold, right from the fridge.  The preserved lemon in the salad was a very refreshing touch.  We both orderd the steak, which was cooked about right and served on a plank with the apprpriate side dishes.

The prices aren't that inexpensive either and certainly not low enough to offset the poor work performance and communication skills of the people there. I had an employee use my spare tire tool in a 1998 Nissan Pathfinder to lower the spare from under the car. He broke the tool and put it back in the car. I discovered the broken tool and got them to admit doing it. What happened next was extremely frustrating. They made long and energetic excuses and blame Nissan. They promised to give me a replacement tool, which sounded fine. I kept calling back (over and over) to get resolution, a very common, \"I don't get paid to help the customer\" tactic used in the tire dept. I spoke with all the people I could and NO ONE at the Goleta store was any help. It finally worked. I gave up calling back. It was not worth the frustration.

No one likes being lectured on what they are doing wrong but I got tired of the constant nagging about my teeth. The last time I went to the dentist to get a cleaning was about 4 years ago and I was driven away because the dentist was so rude about me having less molars than other's (they just never came in)  and stated that I had 4 cavities. I finally decided to go back to the dentist and try someone else. I can honestly say that going to Precise Dental was a really great decision that has changed my view about dentists. Dr. Tanner and his team were so nice. They understood that I was just missing molars and just moved on. They preformed x-rays that were super quick and easy. I also found out that I don't have any cavities and was told that my teeth are looking very healthy. The only thing they had to fix was a filling that my previous dentist messed up.

She also did not answer any of my questions, leaving me disappointed and without some of the toppings I would've wished for. My friend was a few people behind me and it took them about 20 minutes to get through the two people before him and serve him. I could've almost gotten a sit down meal in that time!\nFreshness: 3\/5 - while the meat looked decently fresh, the 'fresh' guacamole they took out was completely brown but they did not seem concerned. They also happily mixed the fresh ingredients with the rest of the old ingredients. Their tortillas are so fresh though, which is great.\nTaste: 4.5\/5 - honestly, the burrito was filled to the brim and the taste was delicious after I added my own hot sauce (which I never got a chance to add since they ignored my question). The mango salsa was also fresh and delicious. This gave me two meals, and the Chile verde (seasonal) is a pork with a little kick.\n\nOverall, I may or may not go back.

Don't get me wrong, IV has some great food, but I was suspicious, because it was fairly dead and my friends and I walked in right during what is normally a rush-y time in IV: the lunch hour.  Boy, was I surprised.  The menu was divinely huge.  We were quickly informed that breakfast is served all day, and includes a diverse bagel menu with many kinds of cream cheese.  There are a zillion varieties of egg dishes offered, with every kind of meat, cheese, and vegetable you could possibly desire, from scrambulated to omelets to benedict.  Meat choices included bacon, ham, different kinds of sausages, corned beef hash, chorizo, and so on and so on.  They offered belgian waffles with fruit and whipped topping, different kinds of pancakes, and five kinds of breakfast burritos.  The lunch and dinner menus were huge too.  Tons of sandwiches, with lots of chicken, turkey, beef, burgers, etc.. My friend ordered a beautiful belgian waffle with powdered sugar and strawberries. I opted for a vegetarian breakfast burrito that was stuffed with mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, onions, scrambulated eggs, and jack cheese.  They bring the food out to you, which is lovely, with lots of extra napkins and actual metal flatware--very unusual for IV.  The service was friendly and helpful.

Also when i tasted the overly greasy enchaladas all i could think of was how disappointing it was to pay $8.00 + for a low quality\/quantity meal. The salsa bar is hardly a bar, their was dirt on the counter and the items in the bar looked old. The salsa had no lid to take to go. And it looked like it came out of a cheap store bought salsa. anyways.I will never go there again and i dont recommend anyone to go and try. It's not worth it.","stars":1}

What kind of company is this?? I'm allergic to roaches and up at 5:30 am because of it. Is this how you treat an infestation?!

I found a list on Tucson Foodie of date-night restaurants and Le Rendez-vous was on it! Being a huge francophile and a foodie, I couldn't believe I had never heard of it! We took the chance and made the reservation for that night, and I'm so glad we did! I don't think I can adequately explain the elation that each dish brought. We got:\n\n- Escargot, which I must say, was much better than the escargot we happened to have in Paris. Instead of serving it in shells, it was served in a dish with little divots filled with melted butter, herbs and the escargot itself. \n\n-Mussels in a white wine sauce. We enjoyed the sauce so much that we rather embarrassingly sopped up every bit of it with our (delicious) bread. \n\n-Beef Wellington. This struck me as a very traditional beef Wellington but I can't speak to the taste because my husband loved it so much that he wouldn't let me have any. I joked that he was going to leave me for this dish and he didn't correct me haha. \n\n-I got the duck. It was all dark meat with a sweet cherry sauce, and it was crispy outside but moist inside. It was a huge portion too! \n\n-Because it was my birthday, they brought me a souffl\u00e9 for dessert, even though the kitchen was closing. The souffl\u00e9 was light, fluffy and not too sweet. \n\nOverall, the service was superbly friendly and attentive and the entire experience was a delight. Many of my friends had never heard of this place either, so I haven't stopped everyone I know that they have to go here!","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"Let me start off by saying that I would actually be giving this place a 4.5 star rating, if that was possible. I honestly think this is in my top 5 nightlife spots in Reno. This was a great way for my friends and I to end the evening after eating in the downtown area.\n\nDrinks (4.5\/5)\nI ordered the Cool Runnings. It had lime and a mixture of tropical light flavors. Definitely would recommend this as a summer drink, because it makes you feel like your on the beach. It was not overly strong, which I appreciated. I am also an ice fanatic, don't ask me why, but I felt that really added to the cocktail. I will say that the drink is relatively small, but is understandable as it is more for sipping. For $12, it's not a horrible price point for this type of cocktail quality.\n\nService (4\/5)\nThe bartender was very nice. She made small chit chat to explain the band logo on her mask. She talked about how they used to have live music at their location, so I will have to check that out once it returns. The busser was a little too persistent about checking if they could take the drinks from the table. All-in-all, decent service.\n\nAmbience\/Environment (5\/5)\nThe concept for this place is awesome. It basically is a house. You feel like you are at a house party in college again! The music variety is great. Lighting is relaxing. They have heat lamps outside. It's fun to explore all the different parts of the house. This is a really unique experience to check out.\n\nMy friends all really enjoyed their beverages too. I hope to get food from here in the future to review on as well.\n\nPlease always remember, don't drink and drive!","stars":4}

This was a very different experience eating indoors at a restaurant in well over a year. \n\nWe arrived and were immediately seated. Plenty of seating indoors, and the place is so big that you don't even see other tables seated. That's an A+ on physical distancing. \n\nWait staff came by quickly and took our drink and food orders. In about 20 minutes, everything came out freshly cooked and hot. Throughout dinner, the staff checked in on us and made sure we were good.  That's an A+ on service. \n\nWe had a variety of food but one of the common elements we had was the rice pilaf. This in particular was less than stellar. It tasted like Uncle Ben's boxed rice and was very hard, almost like it was not cooked. Some rice grains we're hard like little pebbles. Needless to say, that wasn't edible. Everything else - steaks and chicken - was cooked wonderfully. Overall it's a B on food. Yes, a solid letter grade drop because of the rice. \n\nStill would come back in the future but not ordering the pilaf anymore.","stars":4}

Couldn't wait to have a nice family dinner there again.  Tonight, it was horrible.  My husband was served a prime rib that was not cooked.  Not cooked, at all, not even kidding!! Red\/raw on one side. Not rare, not even warm.  Even worse, yes, EVEN WORSE, it was apparently an \"end piece\", so the other side of it was gray-green (meat gray-green=not a good thing!), rubbery, greasy, huge rind of fat, just disgusting.  It was obviously turning rotten.  He couldn't even manage to order anything else, the server offered, the manager offered, the host up front offered, but he had no appetite.  The manager, Jennifer, tried to explain how their prime rib is cooked \"to temperature\" and that's why \"it might have been rarer than he wanted.\"   Husband asked her if she had actually seen his plate, she said that she had seen a prime rib plate that was red, but didn't know if it was his. So how many other prime rib plates were served there tonight, that she saw, that were just as disgusting as his?  She brought him a $25 gift card for our next visit, which we don't plan on ever using.  It was supposed to be a nice night out with our family.  Even with no charge for his dinner, it was still more than $80 for the other four of us, even with three of us ordering items less than $20 ea.

We spent $100 on our whole meal and couldn't have found a bigger waste to put $100 towards. The restaurant closed at 10:00 pm, at 9:40, the girl at the front desk dropped off the check (we had just received our meal and it took a long time to receive it in the first place) we started eating our meal when all of a sudden, 3 minutes later, the front desk girl comes over to ask if we paid yet (we had not since we just started eating and still had 20 minutes until the restaurant closed) we told her no and continued eating, figuring we would be done in the next 10 minutes anyways. No more then 2 minutes later, she came back, AGAIN to ask for the check, after telling her no again, she came back ONE MINUTE later and THEN she sent over the waitress (again, it wasn't even 9:50 by this point and we were told upon entering that it was okay to be there until 10 and later if we needed, which we knew we didn't need since we just wanted to get a quick bite). None the less, after being harassed 10 times in 10 minutes, we paid our bills and were handed boxes and rushed out BEFORE 10. We were not, rude or loud or ignorant or of any sort a nuisance to them, they just wanted to leave early. Don't get me wrong, I used to work as a waitress for a restaurant for many years and I understand that you want to get out on time but you NEVER rush customers out of a restaurant. If I had done that at my old job, my boss would have FIRED ME ON THE SPOT. I was required to allow customers to sit down all the way until 9:59 and we closed at 10.

I've left it hopes of finding a better dish  \n- Pan Roast with Combo seafood (shrimp, crab, oysters, etc). As confusing as this name is, this is a soup. You'd think the chef uses fresh seafood, pan roasts it before tossing all into a stew, but I would bet this is premade. Shrimp was over cooked, as if sitting in a hot soup for eons. Soup base is too creamy IMO - I'm going to ask for less cream or more broth next time, in case they can personalize.\n\nWe visited the other day and were disappointed in the changes from the new management.

For our entrees, our table had a mix between the harvest salad with salmon and seared ahi and the octopus tacos. First, the salad by mass was roughly 80% potato, which was clearly boiled the day before, refrigerated, and then served. There was no water cress in any three of the salads, although it wouldn't make any difference if there were. The tuna was the blandest piece of fish I have ever tried (think Trader Joe's frozen and unseasoned) and the corn was not roasted as advertised.

{"region":"WEST","text":"Small set-up right in the same parking lot as the batting cages. Friendly service and easy menu to order from. My husband and I were mainly looking to just try their tacos (they offer fish & chips, taquitos, egg rolls, and chicken strips too just to name a few).\n\nTacos range from $4-6. \n\nBetween my husband and I, we went for the Gangnam Style, Batter Up, Spicy Crispy Shrimp, and the Ahi Poke tacos. Both of our favorites were the Gangnam and the Ahi Poke tacos. Total was a little under $30 with a drink. Super fresh and tasty ingredients. \n\nReally chill place, definitely happy we stopped by!","stars":5}
{"region":"WEST","text":"A big five stars here!  Arrived for a dinner reservation for seven and they were able to re-adjust our accommondations when three of our party couldn't show.  The hostess cordially greeted us and thanked us for choosing their place.  We were led to a lovely dining area (though the plastic flowers and the single un-clothed table looked strange in the center of the room).  Chairs were comfortable and we were brought two generous portions of bread, one hot sourdough and another crispy, crunchy garlic that I could have eaten all night.  The four different bruschetta types in the appetizer were quite tasty.  When we were told the specials, I decided to order the lasagna instead of the spaghetti and meatballs that I'd originally planned.  No disappointment there! A great portion, tasty in every layer (noodles, sauce, meat, cheese) and I polished off the whole plate, which is not usual for me to do.  Others were equally happy with their chosen dishes.  The highlight for me was the dessert, Florentine cup which was ice cream inside of a \"waffle cone\" made of sliced almonds and hard sugar.  Kudos to Tricia, our waitress, who took good care of us and made sure we were served timely through the whole meal, including passing our compliments to the chef.\n\nI look forward to coming back when I'm in the area again!!","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"Jennifer is the absolute BEST! I have been getting my lash extensions done by Jennifer for almost a year now and I am still in love! She always makes sure she is keeping my natural lashes healthy, but also gives me amazing, voluminous lashes each time. She makes the whole experience very relaxing, you could almost take a nap! (Which I'm sure lots of people do.) :)","stars":5}
{"region":"WEST","text":"We stopped in here the other night wanting some pho. We arrived around 6:15 and grabbed a table right away. Not long after, the place filled up and finding a table would have been difficult. My sons ordered beef fried rice to share. I tell you it could have fed 3 people. The rice was perfectly cooked and the beef was tender. I ordered the seafood pho which was the best seafood pho I've ever had. It was more meat than I expected and full of salmon, scallops, shrimp, and mussels. Everything tasted fresh and was not over cooked. My hubs ordered the beef pho special which came with an order of California rolls. The meat was all lean with no fat and the broth was perfect. I am a sushi lover and was dying to try some of their sashimi and rolls however, being pregnant, I will have to wait to go back for the fresh sushi. Judging by the California rolls, I am sure it will be excellent. The rice was not too sticky, seaweed was high quality and not too fishy. The crab was fresh and not too creamy, leaving for flavor that typically lacks in California rolls. In addition, the cucumber and avocado were fresh. The pickled ginger (my personal favorite) tasted fresh and not from the jar which is what I expect from any sushi place but sometimes hard to find. We also ordered the egg rolls which is my hubby's favorite. They were small but tasty and the sweet and sour sauce they came with was amazing. The staff was attentive and friendly but not annoying. They checked in periodically but gave us our privacy to enjoy our meal. The restaurant was clean and the lighting was so relaxing.","stars":5}

{"region":"WEST","text":"Best donuts in town. So delighted that we finally got a specialty donut store in Santa Barbara! I love when they play around with different ingredients for the monthly specials. Clean establishment with professional staff and a delightful owner. The only thing negative I have to say is my poor waistline.","stars":5}
{"region":"WEST","text":"This place is amazing! I love the atmosphere of the public market, I noticed a lot of the containers are compostable\/environmentally-friendly. I've been here a few times and their service is swift and great as they only have a few seats around their bar.\n\nI got the pad Thai with fried tofu. It was very light and actually sweet which was different from other pad thai's I've had. The fried tofu was delicious and the bean sprouts were very fresh! My boyfriend got the Northern Thailand Curry Noodles which he also liked because it was also light but very flavorful with curry. His suggestion would be to eat the wonton noodles while they're hard before they soak in the soup. \n\nTheir Thai tea is also to die for! Highly recommend this Thai fusion place!","stars":5}
{"region":"WEST","text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could figure out how to do half stars on my droid.  The food is good, but not a culinary escapade to write home about.  That being said this is my favorite breakfast place in SB.  Great patio, solid omelettes, and just the right vibe to work your way out of a hangover.","stars":4}
{"region":"WEST","text":"Reno Tattoo Company have some awesome artists, Canyon is my guy but anyone you go to there is top notch with great mentors. The artists are all engaged and even spend time watching and learning from their peers daily. The shop is clean and adheres to the highest standards of safety and sanitation when tattooing and piercing.\n\nI ONLY get tattooed here and I drive all the way from the Sacramento area.","stars":5}
{"region":"WEST","text":"This store has a wide selection of healthy animal products, and knowledge on what exactly should be used for your pet.  Our dog had been vomiting occasionally in the morning, and we brought this up with the clerk there.  They asked what he was eating and what type of dog we had, and immediately suggested a different type of dog food (apparently lamb was easier on his stomach).  He's been fine ever since, and we no longer have to clean up vomit!\n\nThey also bring those heavy bags of dog food out for you, which is a nice touch.  I appreciate the level of service this place has, and will continue to shop there.","stars":5}
